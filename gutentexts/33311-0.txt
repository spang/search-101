PREFACE

[Decoration]


Upon the reviving perception of the true scope of Latin teaching has
followed a return to some of the methods of former times, which, with
all their faults, were yet imbued with the true spirit of the Classics.
Since for many years the study of Latin lay in bondage to the spirit
which regarded the language merely as a _corpus vile_ for grammatical
dissection, and ignored the rich literature lying beyond the classical
trinity of authors, it is not surprising that it fell into disfavor as
unsuited to the requirements of the times. The revival upon which the
study has now entered is due largely to a recognition of the fact that
mental culture rather than mere mental training is its true aim, and
that, with this aim kept steadily in view, the study of Latin is not a
barren waste of time and energy, but a most potent agency in securing
that broad and sympathetic culture which must ever remain the mark of
the educated man. The results of classical study most valuable to the
character are surely not to be found in the ability, usually lost
after a few years, to recite paradigms faultlessly, to give the
principal parts of verbs, and to enumerate the various kinds of
_cum_-constructions and the subdivisions of the ablative. Of far greater
worth are the mental breadth and sympathy, the weakening of prejudice
and Philistinism, and the increased power of entering into higher forms
of enjoyment which must inevitably flow from the study of the life of a
great people as revealed in its literature and art.

This conception of the sphere of Latin study has brought with it some
modifications of the initial steps and a return to some of the texts in
use fifty years since. In the traditional sequence of authors, and
particularly in the selection of a purely military work as the means by
which to introduce the student to the language, the entrance into the
fields of Latin literature has frequently been made so distasteful as to
destroy the desire for further exploration. More attractive paths,
however, are opening to the beginner; and of these the _Viri Romae_
offers in a notable degree material of real interest to the young, and,
from the very outset, gives a foretaste of the contents of the
literature.

The history of this work is of interest, as showing an early recognition
of the correctness of the standpoint to which we are now returning. It
was compiled by a Professor of the University of Paris, Charles François
Lhomond, who lived from 1727 to 1794, and enjoyed an enviable reputation
as a successful teacher, especially of younger pupils. His experience
taught him the need of an introductory text combining interest of story
with simplicity of style. The best proof of the excellence of his work
is the fact that it has ever since remained a favorite with teachers of
Latin. The material is taken from the works of various authors, chiefly
Livy and Eutropius, but was simplified by Lhomond in vocabulary and
construction wherever necessary to fit it to the requirements of
beginners. As its title indicates, it deals with the early stories of
Rome, so fascinating in any dress to the young, and it is therefore
eminently fitted to arouse a desire for further reading.

The present edition has been prepared with reference to the difficulties
most likely to embarrass the young pupil at the outset of the new study.
One of the most perplexing of these difficulties is the inability to
discover in an alphabetical vocabulary the inflected forms encountered
in the text. This is met, in part at least, by giving in italics in the
footnotes the vocabulary form of verbs not easily recognizable. For a
similar reason grammatical constructions are, on their first occurrence,
explained in simple language, or their nature briefly indicated, in
order that the student may more intelligently consult the grammatical
references which follow. For purposes of comparison, and as a means of
helping the pupil to form proper habits of study and observation,
subsequent occurrences are referred to previous instances, or to the
tables of constructions on pages xvi-xxvi.

Although the compiler of the _Viri Romae_ greatly simplified the
language of his authorities, there yet remain in the early part of the
book many constructions which the beginner is not fitted to discuss. It
is strongly recommended, therefore, that the treatment of the more
difficult and complex of these constructions be postponed to a later
period. At the outset the attention of the pupil should be centered upon
matters of primary importance and upon the simplest and most common
usages, such as the form of the sentence, the relation of its parts to
one another, the significance of terminations, and the modes of
expressing the constantly recurring relations of time, place, cause,
means, purpose, and result. Even these should be treated as simply as
possible and with constant regard to English usage. It is the experience
of many teachers that reference to a Latin grammar to explain a
construction possessed by English as well as by Latin frequently creates
a difficulty where the student, if left to his own devices, would have
experienced none.

The notes on matters of Roman custom have been made intentionally full
with the aim of adding reality to the stories, and of inducing the
pupil, under the teacher’s guidance, to discover for himself further
details. The use of other accounts, whether in ancient or modern
authors, of photographs, plates, and other graphic aids can not be too
strongly encouraged, in accordance with the dictum of Horace:--

  Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures
  Quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus.

All vowels known to be long have been carefully marked. The text of this
edition is, in the main, that of C. Holzer (tenth edition, Stuttgart,
1889). In orthography, however, Brambach has been followed. In the
vocabulary compound verbs are given under the simple verbs as an aid to
the fuller appreciation of the methods by which they are formed and
their meanings derived. The exercises in prose composition have been
made simple in order that they may occupy their legitimate place as
subordinate and auxiliary to the development of the more important
reading power.

The thanks of the editors are due to Mr. E. G. Warner, of the Brooklyn
Polytechnic Institute, for his hearty coöperation in the work, and
particularly for the labor which he has expended upon the exercises.

SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT

[Decoration]

To read Latin quickly and intelligently, and to enjoy the reading
properly, we must possess (1) a vocabulary, _i.e._ a collection of Latin
words with whose meanings, whether used singly or in combination, we are
thoroughly familiar; (2) a knowledge of the inflectional system of the
language, _i.e._ its declensions and conjugations; (3) a knowledge of
its syntax; and (4) a knowledge of the plan upon which the Latin
sentence is constructed, or, in other words, we must be able to overcome
the difficulties arising out of the peculiar order of the words and
clauses that form a Latin sentence.

#Vocabulary.#--Words are the material out of which sentences are
constructed. Hence it is of prime importance to know their meanings. The
best way, in fact the only way, to acquire a vocabulary, is by constant
reading, and by noting carefully the force of individual words as they
occur. It soon becomes evident that certain words are very frequently
used, especially verbs which denote actions that have to do with
everyday life, such as _dīcō_, _eō_, _faciō_, _habeō_, _veniō_, _sum_,
and their compounds. These at least must be mastered at the very outset.
It is worth while to notice what prefixes are used in forming compound
verbs, and the modifications of meaning which they produce. If the force
of the simple verb is mastered, a little practice will enable the
student to detect at sight the meaning of any of its compounds without
reference to any dictionary.

It is useful also to group together in memory words derived from the
same stem, _e.g._ _canō_, _cantus_; _certō_, _certāmen_; _dūcō_, _dux_;
_regō_, _rēx_, _rēgius_; _caedō_, _caedēs_. A specially interesting
study consists in noting the English words which go back to Latin
originals. From various causes a large part of our English vocabulary is
borrowed from Latin. Cf. _donate_ with _dōnō_ and _dōnum_, _lucid_ with
_lūx_, _regent_ with _rēx_ and _regō_.

Finally, it will be found very helpful constantly to read Latin aloud,
for thus the _ear_ will help the _eye_ and words will have meaning when
_heard_ as well as when _seen_. Indeed, we ought to use our ears far
more than our eyes in acquiring a Latin vocabulary, in order that Latin
words, when heard, shall suggest at once to our minds the same pictures
which they suggested to the minds of Roman boys.

#Inflections and Syntax.#--It is not enough, however, to be familiar
with the meanings of individual words, however many we may succeed in
mastering. We must possess a knowledge also of _inflections_, _i.e._ of
the declensions and conjugations, which tell us how individual words may
be altered in form in order to express different relations to other
words, and of _syntax_, which tells us how words are combined together
into sentences. A knowledge of inflections and an understanding of
syntax are the tools by which we arrive at the meaning of sentences as a
whole. As the wise workman uses the best and most efficient tools, so
one who undertakes to read Latin with speed and pleasure must make his
mastery of inflections and syntax as complete as possible. It is assumed
that students of this book have already had some drill in the commoner
inflections. The principles of syntax can best be studied as they occur
in actual reading. The commonest, and therefore most important, are
discussed in the notes and illustrated by appropriate references to the
grammars in common use and by the tables of constructions on pages xvi
to xxvi. A very practical way of fixing the principles of syntax firmly
in mind is by frequent translation from English into Latin. It should be
remembered, however, that we study syntax simply because such study
enables us to read and enjoy the great works of Latin literature.

#The Order of Words.#--The greatest difficulty that confronts the
student of Latin literature is the fact that the order of the words in a
Latin sentence is widely different from that which he ordinarily finds
in an English sentence. This difference is due mainly to two causes.
(1) Every Latin sentence is a kind of word picture, in which the meaning
is developed stroke by stroke, _the separate parts being introduced in
the order of their importance_. (2) It is a principle of Latin to keep
the meaning in suspense until the very end, so that the last word
completes not only the form, but also the meaning of the sentence. Both
these principles may be seen at work in lines 1 to 5 of selection I,
page 1. _Proca_ naturally stands first, partly because the whole work is
a story of the deeds of men, partly because at this point he is
especially important, as being the reigning king, with power to choose
his own successor. The phrase _rēx Albānōrum_ very properly follows, as
defining the scene of the action. _Numitor_ and _Amūlius_ are next
mentioned because the Latin loves to emphasize contrasts of persons. The
sense of the whole is not complete till we reach the very last word,
_habuit_. In the next sentence _Numitōrī_ is first, because now Numitor
is more important, as being Proca’s successor. The relative clause _quī
. . . erat_ not only states a fact, but also gives the reason why Proca
bequeathed his kingdom (_rēgnum relīquit_) to Numitor. So in the words
_ut . . . fēcit_, the _ut_-clause tells why Amulius performed the act
indicated by the words _Rhēam Silviam . . . fēcit_, so that by the time
we know _what_ the act was we know also exactly _why_ it was performed.
The Latin thus pictures the parts of the scene in their true order, for
the motive in every case precedes the act. We see therefore that,
however strange at times the Latin order may seem to be, there is always
good reason for it. It is our task at the outset, as it soon will be our
pleasure, to determine just what this reason is.

Now this freer order of words in the Latin sentence is rendered possible
by the fact that Latin possesses an elaborate inflectional system,
whereas English does not. Note, however, that one familiar with Latin
declensions would know at once that in the first sentence discussed
above Proca was actor (_i.e._ subject), and Numitor and Amulius acted
upon (_i.e._ object). So in the sentence _ut . . . fēcit_ it is clear
that Amulius is the actor and that Rhea Silvia is acted upon. Thus the
inflectional system serves to relieve, in part at least, the very
difficulty which it creates.

#How to Read.#--By far the best way for the beginner to make himself
familiar with the Latin order and its meaning is to _make a practice
from the very outset of reading the sentence aloud from beginning to end
before attempting to translate at all_. If the meaning is not clear at
once, a repetition of such reading will often serve to make it clear,
provided the student knows the force of the individual words and
constructions. If he does not, he must seek the aid of the vocabulary or
the notes. Then let him read the sentence once more aloud, slowly and
carefully. He should not, however, look into either vocabulary or notes
until he has read the Latin through at least once. Progress at first
will necessarily be slow, but it will be sure. By every page read in the
manner indicated above the pupil is preparing himself to read with more
and more intelligence and pleasure the pages that remain. Besides, in
this way he reads his Latin precisely as he reads English, word after
word, in the order in which it is written, and precisely as a Roman boy
1800 years ago read his Latin story or poem. He will gain further the
advantage of training his ear as well as his eye and of making it do its
fair share of the work. In translating, too, it will be wise to follow
as closely as possible the Latin order. Often it will be found that the
resulting English order, even if not very common, is none the less
intelligible. So the sentence _ut . . . fēcit_ discussed above may be
translated almost exactly in the Latin order.


LATIN COMPOSITION

#Its Value.#--An exercise which is very practical and helpful, and which
may also become extremely delightful, is the rendering into Latin of
English sentences based upon that portion of the Latin text which has
already been carefully studied. This exercise is helpful, because it
calls upon us to put into practice the knowledge which we have acquired
in reading; it may become delightful because it shows us accurately the
measure of our advance and thus affords us the pleasure which comes from
the feeling that one is making sure progress in a given line of study.

#Essentials.#--To write Latin well one needs precisely the things which
we found necessary in reading (page ix). The words and constructions
required in the sentences for translation given on pages 112 to 129 are
illustrated by the corresponding pages of the Latin text. The pupil
should always endeavor to recall the word, inflectional form, phrase, or
construction for himself before referring to his text or to his grammar.
In other words, he should make the exercise one of thought rather than
of mere mechanical copying from a printed model.

#The Object.#--We read the Latin text in order to understand the
thoughts of the writer. So in turning English sentences into Latin our
chief object is to clothe the _thoughts_ which such sentences convey in
proper Latin dress, not merely to substitute Latin _words_ for English
_words_. Every language has its own peculiar expressions, which are
called _idioms_. Such expressions can never be literally translated from
one language into another. Hence in attempting to turn an English
sentence into Latin, we must begin by noting carefully the thought which
it expresses, and then consider how the Romans gave expression to that
thought.

#Choice of Expression.#--In Latin, just as in English, it often happens
that the same thought may be expressed in several ways, which differ
greatly in the words used as well as in the form and expression. In
English it is often impossible to give a reason for the choice of one
form of expression in preference to others. Sometimes the choice is made
consciously for the sake of variety, or because there is a very slight
shade of difference in meaning,--so slight that we can perhaps feel it,
but cannot put it into words; sometimes unconsciously, because every one
falls into the habit of using certain phrases and manners of speech with
no deeper reason than the habit. The same is true of Latin writers.
Their various forms of expression have been noted and collected, and we
find them laid down in the grammars as _rules_. Some of these
expressions are found to be used by the best writers more frequently
than others, and these are considered the best models. But the student
must avoid the error of confining himself absolutely to one iron-bound
form because most stress is laid upon it by the grammars, if he finds
other modes of expression in the writings of good authors. By searching
out the greatest variety of forms in which an idea may be expressed, by
trying to discover the differences in meaning between them, and by
placing yourself as far as possible in the writer’s place, you will gain
a far greater grasp and appreciation of the language than by learning a
single rigid rule and forcing it to fit every case.

One of the central ideas of the following exercises, then, should be to
render the thought in as many ways as possible, drawing your authority
from the text on which the exercise is based, as well as from your
grammar.

Examine the tables on pages xvi to xxvi, where you will find several of
the most important constructions treated. Compare the examples given and
try to trace out the reasons for the different forms. In many cases you
will not be able to do so, and are free to choose one of several modes
of expression. In others the meaning of the sentences and the aid of the
grammar will give the reason for your choice.

#Caution.#--The pupil should note that all the words and constructions
necessary to enable him to write in Latin the sentences given below,
pages 112 to 129, are to be found on the pages of the Latin text upon
which the exercises are based. _An English-Latin vocabulary or
dictionary is, therefore, wholly unnecessary._ Additional sentences
based on the text may be made up by student or teacher as required.


TABLES OF CONSTRUCTIONS

The following tables have been prepared for the purpose of affording the
pupil material for study and comparison, by grouping together under
appropriate heads examples of certain constructions as they actually
occur in this book. It is expected that they will be helpful to the
student in two ways: (1) by supplementing and illustrating the notes,
and (2) by affording him guides which he may follow in his writing of
Latin. No attempt whatever has been made to include under any given head
all the examples that are to be found in the text. The pupil will find
it both interesting and instructive to add to the lists himself as he
finds new instances in his own reading.

  #ut# apud omnēs plūrimum #posset#, VIII, 6.

Note that in the main clause there is usually some word like #ita#,
#adeō#, #tam#, #tālis#, #is#, which paves the way for the result clause.

  invenīrī potuit nēmō, #quī . . peteret#, XXIII, 119; Ūnus adulēscēns
  fuit, #quī audēret# querī, XXIV, 50. Here too belongs #quīn# with

the present):

  Ea rēs #dum# Numitōris animum anxium #tenet#, I, 36; #dum# Albānus
  exercitus #inclāmat# Cūriātiīs, IV, 23; Latīnus #dum# ad Tiberim

3. #Dum#, #dōnec# (until) with the subjunctive:

  #dum convalēsceret# (indirect discourse also), VII, 17; ut tempus
  extrāheret, #dōnec# novae cōpiae ex Āfricā #advenīrent#, XVII,
  3 (partly purpose).

  #cum# iīs #īnsidiātī essent# latrōnēs, I, 22; #cum# Numitor . .
  #comparāret#, I, 30; #cum# (as) Rōmae #appropinquārent#, II, 15; cum
  (while) . . cōntiōnem . . #habēret#, II, 44; Quī #cum# Rōmam
  #vēnisset#, III, 2. This form of temporal clause is extremely
  common.

    [Footnote I.4: Cf. also Ablative Absolute, _K_ 3.]


_H._ CAUSAL CLAUSES[I.5]

1. Relative clause with the subjunctive:

  quīppe #quī cerneret# ferrum ante oculōs micāns, accūsātiōnem
  dīmīsit, XIII, 8; cum in eam cīvitātem animadvertere dēcrēvisset
  #quae# (= cum ea) sibi #adversāta fuisset#, XXVII, 37.

2. #Cum# with the subjunctive:

  #Cum# vērō uxōrēs . . nōn #habērent#, lēgātōs circā vīcīnās gentēs
  mīsit, II, 3; #cum# sē invidiōsum . . #vidēret#, Vēientēs . .
  adversus Rōmānōs concitāvit, IV, 55; #Cum# . . facinora clandestīna
  #fierent#, Ancus carcerem . . aedificāvit, V, 21-25.

3. #Quod#,[I.6] #quia#, #quoniam#, or #quandō#, with the indicative:

  #quia# tribus impār #erat#, . . fugam capessīvit, IV, 18;
  #quandōquidem . . pūgnāvistī#, XIII, 53; #quia# nōn #pāruistī#,
  XIII, 77.

4. #Quod# with the subjunctive:

  cum sē invidiōsum apud cīvēs vidēret, #quod# bellum ūnō paucōrum
  certāmine #fīnīsset#, IV, 55-56 (see note); Tarquinius fīlium . .
  #quod# in proeliō hostem #percussisset#, praetextā . . dōnāvit, VI,
  25-27.

5. #Quasi# with the subjunctive (assumed reason):

  eum accūsantēs, #quasi# Numitōris agrōs īnfēstāre #solitus esset#,
  I, 28; Is cum īrātus ad mortem dūcī iussisset mīlitem, #quasi#
  (because, as was supposed,) #interfēcisset# commīlitōnem, XIII, 65.

NOTE.--These clauses resemble those in 4, as giving the reason ascribed
to some one other than the writer. They show also that the reason is
fictitious, and invented by the person who advances it.

    [Footnote I.5: Cf. also Ablative Absolute, _K_ 4.]

    [Footnote I.6: These conjunctions are regularly used with the
    indicative. They are employed with the subjunctive only when the
    writer is indirectly quoting the reason given by some one else.]


_I._ CONCESSIVE OR ADVERSATIVE CLAUSES

1. #Cum# (although) with the subjunctive:

  #cum retinērētur# ā propinquīs et amīcīs, tamen Carthāginem rediit,
  XVII, 53.

2. #Quamquam# with the indicative:

  #quamquam . . pellēbātur#, XXI, 242.

3. #Quamvīs# with the subjunctive:

  #quamvīs sīs# molestus, XXVI, 158.


_J._ CUM CLAUSES

The temporal, causal, and concessive uses of #cum# have already been
given separately. #Cum# was originally a temporal conjunction. From the
temporal idea were developed its other meanings. So the English _when_
frequently contains the ideas of time and cause, or time and concession
combined, and _while_ also is frequently at once temporal and
concessive. So #cum# also may represent these ideas in combination as
well as separately. In many cases, indeed, it is difficult, if not
impossible, to decide which meaning is more prominent: cf.

  #Cum# (_when_ and _since_) lupa saepius ad parvulōs . .
  #reverterētur#, I, 16; Hīs artibus #cum# (_when_ and _although_)
  Hannibalem Fabius . . #clausisset#, ille . . sē expedīvit, XIX, 31.


_K._ THE ABLATIVE ABSOLUTE

1. FORM.--The ablative absolute consists usually of a noun and a
participle. The participle is generally passive, but often active: #Eō
rēgnante#, IV, 3; #relābente flūmine#, I, 9.

2. Often, however, the ablative absolute consists of a noun and
adjective, or of two nouns, or a noun and pronoun. In such cases there
is an ellipsis of the lost present participle of #sum#:

  #māgnā glōriā# bellī, IV, 75; #parī# ferē #ōrnātū#, X, 6; #Appiō
  iūdice#, XII, 15; #Valeriō# et #Cossō cōnsulibus#, XIV, 1.

3. MEANING.--The ablative absolute may denote

  TIME; compare Temporal Clauses, _G_ 1, 2, and 5.

  #pulsō frātre#, rēgnāvit, I, 3; #Eā rē cōgnitā#, parvulōs . .
  abiēcit in Tiberim, I, 5; #armātīs pāstōribus#, Albam properāvit,
  I, 25.

NOTE.--This is the original and most frequent use of the ablative
absolute.

4. CAUSE: compare Causal Clauses, _H_ 2 and 3.

  #ortā# inter eōs #contentiōne#, I, 40; dūrissimā squāmārum #lōrīcā#
  omnia tēla facile #repellente#, XVII, 22; in cōnfertā multitūdine
  aegrē #prōcēdente carpentō#, XVIII, 17.

5. CONCESSION:

  agrum ēius, #omnibus# circā #vāstātīs#, intāctum relīquit, XIX, 39.

6. Often time and cause together: compare note on Cum Clauses, _J_.
Examples are:

  #mīlitibus# sēgnius #dīmicantibus#, raptum sīgnum in hostem mīsit,
  VII, 9; #occīsō Tatiō#, ad Rōmulum potentātus omnis recidit, II, 40.

7. CONDITION:

  #rē# male #gestā# (if he fails), XVI, 31; nē, #dēsertō# agrō, nōn
  esset (lest, if he neglected his farm, he might not have), XVII, 34.

8. MEANS:

  #advectīs ballistīs# et #catapultīs# (by bringing up, etc.) . .
  dēiciendus hostis fuit, XVII, 23.

9. ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCE:

  #crīnibus passīs#, II, 36; #māgnā glōriā# bellī rēgnāvit, IV, 75;
  scrībā cum rēge #parī ferē ōrnātū# sedēbat, X, 6.

10. The ablative absolute is often best translated by the English
perfect active participle with an object: #armātīs pāstōribus#, I, 25,
_having armed_ the shepherds. A combination of an abl. abs. and a finite
verb is often best rendered by two verbs in the same mood and tense:
#interēmptō Amūliō#, Numitōrem in rēgnum #restituit#, I, 37, _he killed_
Amulius _and restored_ Numitor to the throne.


_L._ PARTICIPLES

In Latin the participles, especially the perfect passive participle, are
used far more frequently than in English, and with a much larger variety
of meanings. The use of the participle tends to produce brevity of
expression. Thus the Latin participle may be equivalent to

1. A RELATIVE CLAUSE:

  #raptae# mulierēs, II, 35; Rōmānus . . male #sustinentem# (= quī
  male sustinēbat) arma Cūriātium cōnficit, IV, 29; ab laniō cultrō
  #adreptō# (with a knife _which he caught up_ from a butcher’s
  stall), XII, 24; #volentibus# (= eīs quī volēbant) cōnsulere sē dē
  iūre praebuit, XIII, 97.

2. A CAUSAL CLAUSE:

  necessitāte #compulsus# indicāvit, I, 24; nōmina mūtāre nōn potuit
  #dēterritus# . . Nāviī auctōritāte, VI, 16; Hōc terrōre cēterī
  #adāctī# nōmina prōmptius dedērunt, XV, 25.

3. A CONCESSIVE CLAUSE:

  #victus# (though beaten) crucis supplicium effūgit, XVI, 30.

4. Latin often uses a perfect passive participle in agreement with a
noun, where, judging from English usage, we should expect a noun with a
limiting genitive:

  ob #virginēs# raptās (on account of the _seizure of_ the maidens),
  II, 14; Annō trecentēsimō ab #urbe conditā# (from the _founding of_
  the city), XII, 1.

5. English is fond of coördinated verbs, that is, verbs in exactly the
same mood, tense, and construction, _e.g._ ‘They took the ass and
saddled him.’ Latin, however, objects to such constructions, and prefers
to replace the former of the two verbs by some other form of expression,
_e.g._ a passive or deponent participle. We have to notice here two
classes of sentences:

(_a_) Such sentences as fulmine #īctum cōnflagrāsse#, IV, 74, which =
fulmine #īctum esse et cōnflagrāsse#, _i.e._ ‘he _was struck_ by
lightning _and burned_,’ etc.

(_b_) such sentences as the following: parvulōs alveō #impositōs
abiēcit#, I, 6 = parvulōs alveō #imposuit et abiēcit#; #ēlatam# secūrim
in ēius caput #dēiēcit#, VI, 37 = #extulit# secūrim #et# in ēius caput
#dēiēcit#; cōniugem ē Cūriā #ēvocātum# . . rēgem #salūtāvit#, VII, 47 =
cōniugem ē Cūriā #ēvocāvit et# eum rēgem #salūtāvit#.


_M._ INDIRECT DISCOURSE

1. INDIRECT DISCOURSE DEFINED.--The terms _Direct Discourse_ and
_Indirect Discourse_ denote the two distinct ways in which a writer may
quote the statement or represent the thought of another person. If the
writer gives the exact words in which the statement was made, or in
which the thought was formulated (if put into words at all), he is said
to use the _direct_ discourse. If, on the other hand, he gives merely
the substance or the gist of his own or another’s statements or
thoughts, he is said to use the _indirect_ discourse. In Latin, as in
English, the indirect discourse is more common than the direct.

2. In passing from the direct discourse to the indirect, numerous
changes become necessary. These may, however, be readily grouped under
two heads: (_a_) those which occur in principal clauses, and (_b_) those
which occur in subordinate clauses.

3. CHANGES IN PRINCIPAL CLAUSES.--Principal clauses may be declarative,
interrogative, or imperative; that is, they may make a statement, ask a
question, or give expression to a command. We thus have to consider
three forms of principal clauses: (_a_) Statements, (_b_) Questions,
(_c_) Commands.

4. STATEMENTS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

All Statements of the Direct Discourse, on passing into the Indirect,
fall into the infinitive mood, because they become objects of verbs of
saying:

  adfīrmāns #vīsum# (sc. #esse#) ā sē Rōmulum . . eundemque
  #praecipere#, II, 51 (direct form, #vīsus est# ā mē Rōmulus . .
  īdemque #praecipit#); prōclāmābat fīliam suam iūre #caesam esse#,
  IV, 43 (direct form, fīlia mea iūre #caesa est#); minātur sē vī
  #abstrāctūrum#, XII, 12 (direct form (ego) vī tē #abstraham#).

5. QUESTIONS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

All Questions of the Direct Discourse, on passing into the Indirect,
fall into the subjunctive mood, because they are in reality dependent on
a verb of asking. No example of a question in formal indirect discourse
occurs in the selections contained in this book. Indirect questions
(cf. p. 3, n. 2), however, fall under this general head as giving some
one’s thoughts without quoting his exact words.

6. COMMANDS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

All Commands of the Direct Discourse, on passing into the Indirect, fall
into the subjunctive, because they are in reality dependent on some verb
like _imperāvit_, to be supplied in thought:

  proinde #nē gravārētur# sē spectandum praebēre, XXI, 289 (direct
  form, #Nōlī gravārī# tē spectandum praebēre); satis cōnstat Sullam
  . . prōclāmāsse, #vincerent#, dummodo scīrent, XXVII, 12-15 (direct
  form, #Vincite#, dummodo sciātis).

7. SUBORDINATE CLAUSES IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

All Subordinate Clauses of the Indirect Discourse have their verbs in
the subjunctive mood:

  Tatius . . Tarpēiae optiōnem mūneris dedit, #sī . . perdūxisset#,
  II, 19-21 (direct form, dō or dabō optiōnem mūneris, #sī . .
  perdūxeris#: see note); Illa petiit quod #gererent#, II, 21 (direct
  form, Petō quod . . #geritis#).

    [Illustration: THE HILLS OF ROME]

The original Latin city comprised only the Palatine and a small portion
of the surrounding territory. The Etruscans inhabited the Caelian Hill,
and extended toward the Esquiline. The Sabine town occupied the
Quirinal, which was originally connected with the Capitoline, on which
was the Sabine citadel, by a ridge sloping toward the Forum and the
Campus Martius. Ancus Marcius added to the city the Aventine, and built
a fortress on the Janiculum. Servius Tullius added the Viminal and
Esquiline, and inclosed the seven hills with a line of fortifications,
of which one portion is still traceable. The ridge connecting the
Capitoline and Quirinal was a barrier which cut the town in two. The
only means of communication between the two halves of the city, when its
population had reached nearly two million inhabitants, were the narrow
strip of land between the Capitoline and the river and a lane ten feet
wide crossing the ridge. To relieve the pressure, this ridge was cut
away by the Emperor Trajan, in whose Forum on the site of the
excavations stands the well-known ‘Trajan’s Column,’ 140 feet high,
‘erected to show to posterity how high was the mountain leveled by the
Emperor.’ The business portion of the modern city occupies the Campus
Martius, its main artery, the famous ‘Corso,’ following the line of the
ancient street shown on the plan. See Lanciani, _Ancient Rome_, p. 86.




URBIS RŌMAE VIRĪ INLŪSTRĒS


#I. Romani imperii exordium# [[stripped text]]

Proca, rex Albanorum, Numitorem et Amulium filios habuit. Numitori, qui
natu maior erat, regnum reliquit; sed Amulius, pulso fratre, regnavit
et, ut eum subole privaret, Rheam Silviam, eius filiam, Vestae
sacerdotem fecit, quae tamen Romulum et Remum geminos edidit. Ea re
cognita Amulius ipsam in vincula coniecit, parvulos alveo impositos
abiecit in Tiberim, qui tunc forte super ripas erat effusus; sed,
relabente flumine, eos aqua in sicco reliquit. Vastae tum in iis locis
solitudines erant. Lupa, ut fama traditum est, ad vagitum accurrit,
infantes lingua lambit, ubera eorum ori matremque se gessit.

Cum lupa saepius ad parvulos veluti ad catulos reverteretur, Faustulus,
pastor regius, re animadversa eos tulit in casam et Accae Larentiae
coniugi dedit educandos. Adulti deinde hi inter pastores primo ludicris
certaminibus vires auxere, deinde venando saltus peragrare et latrones a
rapina pecorum arcere coeperunt. Quare cum iis insidiati essent
latrones, Remus captus est, Romulus vi se defendit. Tum Faustulus,
necessitate compulsus, indicavit Romulo quis esset eorum avus, quae
mater. Romulus statim armatis pastoribus Albam properavit.

Interea Remum latrones ad Amulium regem perduxerunt, eum accusantes,
quasi Numitoris agros infestare solitus esset; itaque Remus a rege
Numitori ad supplicium traditus est; at cum Numitor, adulescentis vultum
considerans, aetatem minimeque servilem indolem compararet, haud procul
erat quin nepotem agnosceret. Nam Remus oris lineamentis erat matri
simillimus aetasque expositionis temporibus congruebat. Ea res dum
Numitoris animum anxium tenet, repente Romulus supervenit, fratrem
liberat, interempto Amulio avum Numitorem in regnum restituit.

Deinde Romulus et Remus urbem in iisdem locis, ubi expositi ubique
educati erant, condiderunt; sed orta inter eos contentione, uter nomen
novae urbi daret eamque imperio regeret, auspicia decreverunt adhibere.
Remus prior sex vultures, Romulus postea duodecim vidit. Sic Romulus,
victor augurio, urbem Romam vocavit. Ad novae urbis tutelam sufficere
vallum videbatur. Cuius angustias inridens cum Remus saltu id
traiecisset, eum iratus Romulus interfecit, his increpans verbis: “Sic
deinde, quicumque alius transiliet moenia mea!” Ita solus potitus est
imperio Romulus.

    Among the few Trojans who escaped after the fall of Troy was
    Aeneas, the son of Venus and the hero Anchises. After many
    wanderings Aeneas reached Italy, married there Lavinia, the
    daughter of Latinus, king of the Latins, and founded a town called
    Lavinium, from the name of his wife. He was succeeded by his son
    Ascanius, who founded a second city, called Alba Longa, and
    transferred thither the seat of government. The date traditionally
    assigned to the capture of Troy was 1184 B.C. Hence it is clear
    that Alba Longa was settled more than 400 years before the
    foundation of Rome in 754 B.C. To fill this gap a list of fourteen
    Alban kings, all descendants of Aeneas, was given by the Roman
    writers. How Rome itself was founded from Alba Longa is described
    in the text. It should be kept constantly in mind that little
    faith is to be put in these traditional accounts of Rome’s early
    history, at least as far as details are concerned. Latin writers
    tell us that the oldest records of the city perished in the sack
    of Rome by the Gauls in 388 B.C. The first historical work written
    by a Roman was published about 215 B.C., more than 500 years after
    the foundation of the city. Many of the stories were obviously
    invented to account for institutions which existed in the later
    times, and the traditional narrative is full of inconsistencies
    and contradictions.

    2.8: #impositōs# (_impōnō_) #abiēcit# (_abiciō_) = _imposuit et
    abiēcit_. English is fond of coördination of clauses; Latin
    prefers to subordinate clause to clause. Hence, in general, Latin
    avoids two coördinated verbs. See p. xxiv, L 5, and H 639

    thought of some person other than the writer himself. See p. xxi,
    H 5.
    3.7: _soleō_.
    3.8: #ad supplicium#: ‘to be punished’; _ad_ with its noun often
    denotes purpose.
    3.9: #aetātem . . . comparāret#: ‘compared his age with his
    nature, (which was) by no means that of a slave’; i.e. his
    appearance and demeanor indicated that he belonged to a higher
    station than the shepherds.
    3.10: #haud . . . āgnōsceret#: ‘he came very near to recognizing
    him’; how literally? In this construction _quīn_ = _ut nōn_, and
    the subjunctive is one of result: H 595 (504): M 913: A 319, _d_:

    3.13: ‘very like’; cf. a similar use of the comparative in l. 16.
    3.14: _dum_, ‘while,’ regularly takes the pres. indic. where

    personal pronoun with a conjunction,--generally _and_, often _but_
    or _for_: cf. p. 2, n. 2.
    4.4: ‘in anger.’ An adjective may often be best rendered by an
    adverb or adverbial phrase.

#II. Romulus, Romanorum rex primus# [[stripped text]]

753-715 B.C.

Romulus imaginem urbis magis quam urbem fecerat; incolae deerant. Erat
in proximo lucus; hunc asylum fecit. Et statim eo mira vis latronum
pastorumque confugit. Cum vero uxores ipse populusque non haberent,
legatos circa vicinas gentes misit, qui societatem conubiumque novo
populo peterent. Nusquam benigne audita legatio est; ludibrium etiam
additum: “Cur non feminis quoque asylum aperuistis? Id enim compar foret
conubium.” Romulus, aegritudinem animi dissimulans, ludos parat; indici
deinde finitimis spectaculum iubet. Multi convenere studio etiam
videndae novae urbis, maxime Sabini cum liberis et coniugibus. Ubi
spectaculi tempus venit eoque conversae mentes cum oculis erant, tum
signo dato iuvenes Romani discurrunt, virgines rapiunt.

Haec fuit statim causa belli. Sabini enim ob virgines raptas bellum
adversus Romanos sumpserunt, et cum Romae appropinquarent, Tarpeiam
virginem nacti sunt, quae aquam forte extra moenia petitum ierat. Huius
pater Romanae praeerat arci. Titus Tatius, Sabinorum dux, Tarpeiae
optionem muneris dedit, si exercitum suum in Capitolium perduxisset.
Illa petiit quod Sabini in sinistris manibus gererent, videlicet aureos
anulos et armillas. Quibus dolose promissis, Tarpeia Sabinos in arcem
perduxit, ubi Tatius scutis eam obrui iussit; nam et ea in laevis
habuerant. Sic impia proditio celeri poena vindicata est.

Deinde Romulus ad certamen processit, et in eo loco, ubi nunc Romanum
Forum est, pugnam conseruit. Primo impetu vir inter Romanos insignis,
nomine Hostilius, fortissime dimicans cecidit; cuius interitu
consternati Romani fugere coeperunt. Iam Sabini clamitabant: “Vicimus
perfidos hospites, imbelles hostes. Nunc sciunt longe aliud esse
virgines rapere, aliud pugnare cum viris.” Tunc Romulus, arma ad caelum
tollens, Iovi aedem vovit, et exercitus seu forte seu divinitus
restitit. Itaque proelium redintegratur; sed raptae mulieres crinibus
passis ausae sunt se inter tela volantia inferre et hinc patres, hinc
viros orantes, pacem conciliarunt.

Romulus, foedere cum Tatio icto, et Sabinos in urbem recepit et regnum
cum Tatio sociavit. Verum haud ita multo post, occiso Tatio, ad Romulum
potentatus omnis recidit. Centum deinde ex senioribus elegit, quorum
consilio omnia ageret, quos senatores nominavit propter senectutem. Tres
equitum centurias constituit, populum in triginta curias distribuit. His
ita ordinatis, cum ad exercitum lustrandum contionem in campo ad Caprae
paludem haberet, subito coorta est tempestas cum magno fragore
tonitribusque et Romulus e conspectu ablatus est. Ad deos transisse
vulgo creditus est; cui rei fidem fecit Iulius Proculus, vir nobilis.
Orta enim inter patres et plebem seditione, in contionem processit,
iureiurando adfirmans visum a se Romulum augustiore forma, eundemque
praecipere ut seditionibus abstinerent et rem militarem colerent;
futurum ut omnium gentium domini exsisterent. Aedes in colle Quirinali
Romulo constituta, ipse pro deo cultus et Quirinus est appellatus.

    _Rumon_, ‘river.’ _Rōma_ would then be ‘the town by the river,’
    ‘Rivertown’ (cf. English ‘Watertown,’ etc.), and _Rōmulus_ would
    be ‘the man from Rivertown.’
    4.8: _dēsum_.
    4.9: #in proximō#: ‘near by.’ Phrases consisting of a preposition
    and a neuter adjective are common, and have the force of
    adjectives or adverbs.
    4.10: This grove lay between the two summits of the Capitoline
    Hill.
    4.11: #vīs# often means ‘number,’ as here, or ‘quantity’; ‘power’
    is used in the same sense in some parts of Great Britain.
    4.12: #cum#: ‘since’: H 598 (517): M 863: A 326: G 586: B 286, 2.
    5.1: = _Rōmulus_. Cf. _ipsam_, I, 5.
    5.2: _mittō_.
    5.3: #quī . . . peterent#: rel. clause of purpose; see p. xviii,
    E 2, and H 590 (497, I): M 835: A 317, 2: G 630: B 282, 2.
    5.4: In early times the right of intermarriage did not exist
    between neighboring tribes, except by special treaty.
    5.5: Sc. _est_, which, like _esse_, is often omitted with the
    passive, especially in rapid narrative.
    5.6: = _esset_: H 205, 2 (204, 2): M 327: A 119, N.: G 116, N. 1,
    _c_: B 100, N. 2.
    5.7: #indīcī . . . iubet#: ‘he bids a show to be announced.’ Such
    an announcement would carry with it an invitation to be present.
    5.8: Cf. p. 2, n. 21.
    5.9: i.e. they were not only interested in the games, but they
    were also curious to see the new city.
    5.10: = _in spectāculum_.
    5.11: _convertō_.
    5.12: #mentēs cum oculīs#: ‘minds and eyes alike.’ The emphasis is
    on _mentēs_; they were thinking only of the show.
    5.13: In rapid historical narrative, clauses are often set side by
    side without a connective. See also n. 5 above.
    5.14: #Haec#, referring to the matters related in the preceding
    paragraph, should theoretically be neuter, but is feminine because
    the predicate noun #causa# is feminine. Such attraction is the
    rule in Latin. H 396, 2 (445, 4): A 195, _d_: G 211, 5: B 246, 5.
    5.15: #ob virginēs raptās#: ‘on account of the stolen maidens’ =
    ‘on account of the seizure of the maidens.’ A participle agreeing
    with a noun is preferred in Latin to an abstract noun with a
    dependent genitive.
    5.16: _sūmō_.
    5.17: dat.; why?
    5.18: ‘they happened upon’ (_nancīscor_).
    5.19: #forte . . . ierat#: ‘had gone by chance’ = ‘happened to
    have gone.’ _Forte_ is often best rendered by a clause: ‘as it
    happened,’ or ‘it so happened.’
    5.20: supine denoting purpose; see p. xviii, E 6, and H 633 (546):
    M 1005: A 302: G 435: B 340, 1.
    6.1: The subjunctive here, as in #gererent#, is due to implied
    indirect discourse; #sī perdūxisset# represents the fut. perf.
    indic. of direct discourse _sī perdūxeris_, ‘if you shall have
    led’ = ‘if you (shall) lead’; H 646 (527, I): M 1034, 1038: A 337:
    G 656-7: B 319, B.
    6.2: ‘that which.’
    6.3: _manus_ often = ‘arm,’ just as _pēs_ = ‘leg.’
    6.4: #gererent#: either ‘wore’ or ‘bore.’ Tarpeia meant it in the
    former sense; Tatius chose to understand it in the latter.
    6.5: Why abl.?
    6.6: #et ea# = _ea quoque_: ‘these too,’ as well as the _armillae_
    and _ānulī_.
    6.7: Sc. _manibus_.
    6.8: Note the tense; they _had had_ these, too, on their arms when
    the bargain was struck.
    6.9: See Vocab., _Forum_.
    6.10: #Prīmō impetū#: ‘in the very first charge.’ The ablative
    fixes the time of #cecidit#.
    6.11: #inter . . . īnsīgnis#: ‘the most conspicuous of the
    Romans.’ How literally?
    6.12: abl. of specification.
    6.13: = _morte_. The abl. includes the ideas of means and cause.
    6.14: ‘hosts.’ The relation of host and guest was regarded by the
    Romans, as by other ancient peoples, as peculiarly sacred.
    6.15: #longē aliud . . . aliud#: ‘one thing . . . quite another.’
    Note here the difference between the English and the Latin idiom.
    6.16: Infinitives, because the clauses in which they stand are
    subjects of #esse#; H 615 (538): M 972: A 270: G 422: B 377.
    6.17: This temple was called the Temple of _Iuppiter Stator_, i.e.
    the ‘Stayer,’ the god who had _stayed_ the army’s flight.
    6.18: _resistō_: ‘maintained its ground,’ ‘held its own,’ as
    contrasted with its previous flight (_fugere coepērunt_).
    6.19: #crīnibus passīs# (_pandō_): ‘with streaming hair.’
    6.20: ‘_by_ beseeching’; the abl. of the gerund (_ōrandō_) might
    have been used.
    6.21: #foedere . . . īctō# (_īcō_): ‘having struck a treaty.’ How
    literally? The abl. abs. is one of the regular substitutes in
    Latin for the missing perfect active participle. In the phrase
    _foedus īcere_, the verb suggests the striking of the victims in
    the sacrifice which accompanied the making of the treaty.
    7.1: #rēgnum . . . sociāvit#: i.e. henceforth there were two
    kings.
    7.2: By the inhabitants of Laurentum, whose ambassadors he had
    insulted.
    7.3: Note the force of the prefix: the sovereignty ‘came _back_,’
    or ‘devolved _again_’ upon Romulus, precisely as before he shared
    it with Tatius.
    7.4: abl. of means.
    7.5: Cf. p. 5, n. 3.
    7.6: See Vocab., _eques_.
    7.7: ‘When’: H 600, II (521, II): M 858: A 325: G 585: B 288.
    7.8: #ad . . . lūstrandum# = _ut . . . lūstrāret_. What does the
    gerundive construction express?
    7.9: Sc. _Mārtiō_. See Vocab., _campus_, and map, p. xxviii.
    7.10: #Caprae palūdem#: ‘Goat Swamp.’
    7.11: _auferō_.
    7.12: #crēditus est#: we would say: ‘it was believed that he,’
    etc.; Latin prefers the personal construction, and says: ‘he was
    believed to have,’ etc.
    7.13: #cuī . . . fēcit#: literally ‘for which thing he made (i.e.
    secured) belief (i.e. general acceptance).’
    7.14: What does the abl. abs. here express? See p. xxiii, K 6.
    7.15: _prōcēdō_.
    7.16: Sc. _esse_. #vīsum esse# and #praecipere# depend on
    #adfīrmāns#: see H 642 (523, I): M 1023: A 336, 2: G 650: B 314:
    and p. xxv, M 4.
    7.17: #augustiōre fōrmā#: ‘of more imposing presence’ (than he was
    while on earth); abl. of characteristic, H 473, 2 (419, II):
    M 643: A 251: G 400: B 224.
    7.18: i.e. _Rōmulum_.
    7.19: Note the change of tense from that in _vīsum_ (_esse_)
    above. Proculus actually said: (_Rōmulus_) _praecipit_, i.e. he
    used the historical present. Above _vīsum_ (_esse_) represents
    _vīsus est_ of the direct discourse.
    7.20: substantive clause of purpose; H 565 (498, I): M 892: A 331:
    G 546: B 295, 4.
    7.21: #futūrum ut . . . exsisterent# gives the statement, not of
    Proculus, but of Romulus himself. The inf. #futūrum# (_esse_)
    depends on a verb of saying implied in #praecipere#. Romulus said
    _exsistētis_. Since, however, _exsistō_ has no supine and so no
    future participle, no direct future infinitive can be formed from
    it. Hence the phrase _futūrum ut_ with subjunctive becomes
    necessary: ‘it would happen that they would become,’ etc.
    8.1: ‘in honor of Romulus’; dat. of advantage.
    8.2: With #cōnstitūta# and #cultus# (_colō_) sc. _est_.
    8.3: For the omission of the conjunction before #ipse#, cf. p. 5,
    n. 13.]


#III. Numa Pompilius, Romanorum rex secundus# [[stripped text]]

716-673 B.C.

Successit Romulo Numa Pompilius, vir inclita iustitia et religione. Is
Curibus, ex oppido Sabinorum, accitus est. Qui cum Romam venisset, ut
populum ferum religione mitigaret, sacra plurima instituit. Aram Vestae
consecravit, et ignem in ara perpetuo alendum virginibus dedit. Flaminem
Iovis sacerdotem creavit eumque insigni veste et curuli sella adornavit.
Dicitur quondam ipsum Iovem e caelo elicuisse. Hic, ingentibus
fulminibus in urbem demissis, descendit in nemus Aventinum, ubi Numam
docuit quibus sacris fulmina essent procuranda, et praeterea imperii
certa pignora populo Romano daturum se esse promisit. Numa laetus rem
populo nuntiavit. Postridie omnes ad aedes regias convenerunt
silentesque exspectabant quid futurum esset. Atque sole orto delabitur e
caelo scisso scutum, quod ancile appellavit Numa. Id ne furto auferri
posset, Mamurium fabrum undecim scuta eadem forma fabricare iussit.
Duodecim autem Salios Martis sacerdotes legit, qui ancilia, secreta illa
imperii pignora, custodirent et Kalendis Martiis per urbem canentes et
rite saltantes ferrent. Annum in duodecim menses ad cursum lunae
descripsit; nefastos fastosque dies fecit; portas Iano gemino
aedificavit ut esset index pacis et belli; nam apertus, in armis esse
civitatem, clausus, pacatos circa omnes populos, significabat.

Leges quoque plurimas et utiles tulit Numa. Ut vero maiorem institutis
suis auctoritatem conciliaret, simulavit sibi cum dea Egeria esse
conloquia nocturna eiusque monitu se omnia, quae ageret, facere. Lucus
erat, quem medium fons perenni rigabat aqua; eo saepe Numa sine arbitris
se inferebat, velut ad congressum deae; ita omnium animos ea pietate
imbuit, ut fides ac iusiurandum non minus quam legum et poenarum metus
cives contineret. Bellum quidem nullum gessit, sed non minus civitati
profuit quam Romulus. Morbo exstinctus in Ianiculo monte sepultus est.
Ita duo deinceps reges, ille bello, hic pace, civitatem auxerunt.
Romulus septem et triginta regnavit annos, Numa tres et quadraginta.

    [Footnotes: III (pages 8-10)

    8.4: See p. 7, n. 17.
    8.5: #Curibus . . . Sabīnōrum#: ‘from Cures, a town of the
    Sabines.’ H 462 (412, II): M 605: A 258, _a_: G 391: B 229, 1.
    ‘_At_ Cures, a town of the Sabines,’ would be _Curibus, in oppidō
    Sabīnōrum_. The two phrases well illustrate the difference between
    the treatment of names of towns, and that of common nouns, in
    expressions intended to denote rest in a place, or motion from a
    given point.
    8.6: #ut . . . mītigāret#: purpose clause, to be joined with what
    follows. Phrases and clauses often thus precede the words which
    they modify.
    8.7: #īgnem . . . alendum#: for the form of expression, see p. 2,
    n. 18.
    8.8: #Flāminem . . . creāvit#: ‘he appointed a priest to be
    Jupiter’s Flamen.’ See Vocab., _flāmen_.
    8.9: The distinctive parts of the dress worn by the _Flāminēs_
    were (1) a close-fitting woolen cap, from which projected a stick
    of olive wood, called _apex_; (2) the _toga praetexta_ (see
    Vocab., _toga_); and (3) a laurel crown.
    8.10: See Vocab., _sella_.
    8.11: Cf. p. 7, n. 12.
    8.12: _ēliciō_.
    8.13: The Romans derived many omens from thunder. _Prōcūrāre_ is
    the technical word for ‘caring for’ an omen, i.e. warding off all
    harmful effects by sacrifices.
    9.1: ‘trustworthy.’ This word never = ‘certain,’ as in the phrase
    ‘a certain man.’ In that sense _quīdam_ is used.
    9.2: #aedēs rēgiās#: ‘the palace.’ What two meanings does _aedēs_
    bear?
    9.3: ‘waited (to see) what,’ etc.
    9.4: Why subjunctive? See p. 3, n. 2.
    9.5: _scindō_. #dēlābitur . . . scūtum#: ‘the heavens were opened
    and a shield descended.’
    9.6: Negative clause of purpose: H 568 (497, II): M 893: A 317, 1:
    G 545, 3: B 282. On the possession of this _ancīle_ Rome’s power
    was believed to depend; hence Numa’s care in guarding it.
    9.7: #Saliōs . . . fēcit#: ‘he chose twelve Salii as priests of
    Mars.’
    9.8: Why subjunctive? Cf. p. 5, n. 3.
    9.9: Roman writers say that before Numa’s time the year contained
    only ten months, a statement hardly credible.
    9.10: #nefāstōs . . . fēcit#: ‘he made a distinction between _diēs
    nefāstī_ and _diēs fāstī_.’ See Vocab., _fāstus_ and _nefāstus_.
    9.11: Cf. p. 8, n. 1.
    9.12: ‘two-headed.’ The reference is to a temple of Janus in the
    Forum, with two doors opposite each other, so that the whole
    structure resembled an arch.
    9.13: Both adjectives = temporal clauses, signifying respectively
    ‘when open,’ ‘when shut.’ They agree with _Iānus_ understood,
    which means the temple, not the god. After Numa’s time the temple
    remained open till 235 B.C. It was opened again in the same year,
    and not closed till 29 B.C.
    9.14: #Lēgēs quoque#: ‘_Laws_ too,’ i.e. laws as well as religious
    ceremonies and priestly orders.
    9.15: #īnstitūtīs#: dative with #conciliāret#.
    10.1: How different in meaning from _dissimulāns_, II, 9?
    10.2: #sibi . . . esse conloquia#: ‘that he had conversations.’
    #sibi# is dat. of the possessor; H 430 (387): M 542: A 231: G 349:
    B 190.
    10.3: #ēius monitū#: ‘at her suggestion.’ Cf. _quōrum cōnsiliō_,
    II, 41.
    10.4: #quem medium#: ‘the middle of which.’
    10.5: Here in its original sense of ‘witness.’
    10.6: #velut . . . deae#: ‘giving it out that he was going to meet
    the goddess’; #velut# is used here as _quasi_ is in I, 28. See
    note there [[note 3.6]]. For #ad congressum# see p. 3, n. 8.
    #deae# is dat. after the prefix in #congressum#; cf. H 429 (386):
    M 532: A 228: G 347: B 187, III.
    10.7: #ita# and #eā# reinforce each other. ‘To such a degree
    (#ita#), and with such (#eā#) piety,’ etc.
    10.8: Here = ‘respect for their oaths (and obligations).’ #fidēs
    ac iūsiūrandum# together = ‘their own moral sense,’ as opposed to
    the restraints of the law.
    10.9: subjunctive of result: H 570 (500, II): M 905: A 319, 1:
    G 552, 2: B 284.
    10.10: #quidem# is concessive, and so = ‘to be sure, it is true.’
    Hence #quidem . . . sed# = _quamquam . . . sed tamen_.
    10.11: Sc. _prōfuerat_.
    10.12: #Morbō exstīnctus# (_exstinguō_) means that he died a
    natural death. We are to feel a contrast here to the miraculous
    disappearance of Romulus, as described on page 7.
    10.13: _sepeliō_.
    10.14: #duo deinceps rēgēs#: ‘two _successive_ kings.’ When an
    adverb like _deinceps_ stands between an adjective and a noun, it
    has the value of an adjective.
    10.15: acc. of extent of time: H 417 (379): M 513: A 256, 2:
    G 336: B 181. See also p. xvii, D 1.]


#IV. Tullus Hostīlius, Romanorum rex tertius# [[stripped text]]

673-641 B.C.

Mortuo Numa Tullus Hostilius rex creatus est. Hic non solum proximo regi
dissimilis, sed ferocior etiam Romulo fuit. Eo regnante bellum inter
Albanos et Romanos exortum est. Ducibus Hostilio et Fufetio placuit rem
paucorum certamine finiri. Erant apud Romanos trigemini fratres Horatii,
tres apud Albanos Curiatii. Cum eis agunt reges ut pro sua quisque
patria dimicent ferro. Foedus ictum est ea lege, ut, unde victoria, ibi
imperium esset.

Icto foedere trigemini arma capiunt et in medium inter duas acies
procedunt. Consederant utrimque duo exercitus. Datur signum, infestique
armis terni iuvenes, magnorum exercituum animos gerentes, concurrunt. Ut
primo concursu increpuere arma micantesque fulsere gladii, horror ingens
spectantes perstringit. Consertis deinde manibus, statim duo Romani
alius super alium exspirantes ceciderunt; tres Albani vulnerati. Ad
casum Romanorum conclamavit gaudio exercitus Albanus. Romanos iam spes
tota deserebat. Unum Horatium tres Curiatii circumsteterant. Forte is
integer fuit; sed quia tribus impar erat, ut distraheret hostes, fugam
capessivit, singulos per intervalla secuturos esse ratus. Iam aliquantum
spatii ex eo loco, ubi pugnatum est, aufugerat, cum respiciens videt
unum e Curiatiis haud procul ab sese abesse. In eum magno impetu redit,
et dum Albanus exercitus inclamat Curiatiis ut opem ferant fratri, iam
Horatius eum occiderat. Alterum deinde, priusquam tertius posset
consequi, interfecit.

Iam singuli supererant, sed nec spe nec viribus pares. Alter erat
intactus ferro et geminata victoria ferox; alter fessum vulnere, fessum
cursu trahebat corpus. Nec illud proelium fuit. Romanus exsultans male
sustinentem arma Curiatium conficit, iacentem spoliat. Romani ovantes ac
gratulantes Horatium accipiunt et domum deducunt. Princeps ibat
Horatius, trium fratrum spolia prae se gerens. Cui obvia fuit soror,
quae desponsa fuerat uni ex Curiatiis, visoque super umeros fratris
paludamento sponsi, quod ipsa confecerat, flere et crines solvere
coepit. Movet ferocis iuvenis animum comploratio sororis in tanto gaudio
publico; itaque stricto gladio transfigit puellam, simul eam verbis
increpans: “Abi hinc cum immaturo amore ad sponsum, oblita fratrum,
oblita patriae. Sic eat, quaecumque Romana lugebit hostem.”

Atrox id visum est facinus patribus plebique; quare raptus est in ius
Horatius et apud iudices condemnatus. Iam accesserat lictor iniciebatque
laqueum. Tum Horatius ad populum provocavit. Interea pater Horatii senex
proclamabat filiam suam iure caesam esse; et iuvenem amplexus spoliaque
Curiatiorum ostentans, orabat populum ne se, quem paulo ante cum egregia
stirpe conspexissent, orbum liberis faceret. Non tulit populus patris
lacrimas iuvenemque absolvit admiratione magis virtutis quam iure
causae. Ut tamen caedes manifesta expiaretur, pater quibusdam
sacrificiis peractis transmisit per viam tigillum et filium capite
adoperto velut sub iugum misit; quod tigillum _Sororium_ appellatum est.

Non diu pax Albana mansit; nam Mettius Fufetius, dux Albanorum, cum se
invidiosum apud cives videret, quod bellum uno paucorum certamine
finisset, ut rem corrigeret, Veientes Fidenatesque adversus Romanos
concitavit. Ipse, a Tullo in auxilium arcessitus, aciem in collem
subduxit, ut fortunam belli exspectaret et sequeretur. Qua re Tullus
intellecta magna voce ait suo illud iussu Mettium facere, ut hostes a
tergo circumvenirentur. Quo audito hostes territi et victi sunt. Postero
die Mettius cum ad gratulandum Tullo venisset, iussu illius quadrigis
religatus et in diversa distractus est. Deinde Tullus Albam propter
ducis perfidiam diruit et Albanos Romam transire iussit.

Roma interim crevit Albae ruinis; duplicatus est civium numerus; mons
Caelius urbi additus et, quo frequentius habitaretur, eam sedem Tullus
regiae cepit ibique deinde habitavit. Auctarum virium fiducia elatus
bellum Sabinis indixit. Pestilentia insecuta est; nulla tamen ab armis
quies dabatur. Credebat enim rex bellicosus salubriora militiae quam
domi esse iuvenum corpora, sed ipse quoque diuturno morbo est
implicitus. Tunc vero adeo fracti simul cum corpore sunt spiritus illi
feroces, ut nulli rei posthac nisi sacris operam daret. Memorant Tullum
fulmine ictum cum domo conflagrasse. Tullus magna gloria belli regnavit
annos duos et triginta.


  #IV. Tullus Hostīlius, Rōmānōrum rēx tertius# [[as printed]]

  673-641 B.C.

  Mortuō[16] Numā Tullus Hostīlius rēx creātus est. Hīc nōn
  sōlum proximō[17] rēgī dissimilis, sed ferōcior etiam Rōmulō[18] fuit.
    [[11]]
  Eō rēgnante[1] bellum inter Albānōs et Rōmānōs exortum[2] est.
  Ducibus[3] Hostīliō et Fūfetiō placuit rem[4] paucōrum certāmine[5]
  fīnīrī. Erant apud Rōmānōs trigeminī frātrēs Horātiī, trēs apud    {5}
  Albānōs Cūriātiī. Cum[6] eīs agunt rēgēs ut prō suā quisque
  patriā dīmicent[7] ferrō. Foedus[8] īctum est eā[9] lēge, ut, unde[10]
  victōria, ibi imperium esset.

  Īctō foedere trigeminī arma capiunt et in medium inter duās
  aciēs prōcēdunt. Cōnsēderant utrimque duo exercitūs. Datur        {10}
  sīgnum, īnfēstīque[11] armīs ternī[12] iuvenēs, māgnōrum[13]
      exercituum
  animōs gerentēs, concurrunt. Ut prīmō concursū increpuēre[14]
  arma micantēsque fulsēre[15] gladiī, horror ingēns spectantēs[16]
  perstringit. Cōnsertīs[17] deinde manibus, statim duo Rōmānī alius
  super alium exspīrantēs cecidērunt[18]; trēs Albānī vulnerātī. Ad[19]
  cāsum Rōmānōrum conclāmāvit gaudiō exercitus Albānus. Rōmānōs     {16}
  iam spēs tōta dēserēbat. Ūnum Horātium trēs Cūriātiī
  circumsteterant.[20] Forte[21] is integer fuit; sed quia tribus impār
  erat, ut distraheret hostēs, fugam capessīvit,[22] singulōs[23] per
      intervālla
    [[12]]
  secūtūrōs esse ratus. Iam aliquantum[1] spatiī ex eō locō,        {20}
  ubi pūgnātum est, aufūgerat, cum respiciēns videt ūnum ē Cūriātiīs
  haud procul ab sēsē abesse. In[2] eum māgnō impetū redit,
  et dum Albānus exercitus inclāmat[3] Cūriātiīs ut opem ferant
  frātrī, iam Horātius eum occīderat. Alterum[4] deinde, priusquam[5]
  tertius posset[5] cōnsequī, interfēcit.                           {25}

  Iam singulī[6] supererant,[7] sed nec spē nec vīribus parēs.[8]
      Alter[9]
  erat intāctus ferrō et geminātā victōriā ferōx[10]; alter fessum[11]
      vulnere,
  fessum cursū trahēbat[12] corpus. Nec illud proelium fuit.
  Rōmānus exsultāns male sustinentem arma Cūriātium cōnficit,[13]
  iacentem[14] spoliat. Rōmānī ovantēs[15] ac grātulantēs Horātium  {30}
  accipiunt et domum[16] dēdūcunt. Prīnceps ībat Horātius, trium frātrum
  spolia prae sē gerēns. Cuī[17] obvia fuit soror, quae dēspōnsa
  fuerat ūnī ex Cūriātiīs, vīsōque[18] super umerōs frātris palūdāmentō
  spōnsī, quod ipsa cōnfēcerat, flēre et crīnēs[19] solvere coepit.
      Movet                                                         {34}
  ferōcis iuvenis animum complōrātiō sorōris in tantō gaudiō pūblicō;
  itaque strictō[20] gladiō trānsfīgit puellam, simul eam verbīs[21]
      increpāns:                                                    {36}
  “Abī[22] hinc cum immātūrō amōre ad spōnsum, oblīta[23]
    [[13]]
  frātrum, oblīta patriae. Sīc eat,[1] quaecumque Rōmāna lūgēbit
  hostem.”

  Atrōx id vīsum est facinus[2] patribus[3] plēbīque; quārē raptus  {40}
  est in iūs[4] Horātius et apud iūdicēs condemnātus. Iam accesserat
  līctor[5] iniciēbatque[6] laqueum. Tum Horātius ad populum prōvocāvit.
  Intereā pater Horātiī senex prōclāmābat fīliam suam iūre
  caesam[7] esse; et iuvenem amplexus[8] spoliaque Cūriātiōrum
  ostentāns, ōrābat populum nē[9] sē, quem paulō                    {45}
  ante cum ēgregiā stirpe cōnspexissent,[10] orbum
  līberīs[11] faceret.[9] Nōn tulit populus patris lacrimās
  iuvenemque[12] absolvit admīrātiōne[13] magis
  virtūtis quam iūre[13] causae. Ut tamen caedēs
  manifēsta expiārētur, pater quibusdam[14] sacrificiīs             {50}
  perāctīs trānsmīsit per viam[15] tigillum et fīlium
  capite adopertō velut sub iugum[16] mīsit; quod
  tigillum _Sorōrium_[17] appellātum est.

    [Illustration: FASCĒS]

  Nōn diū pāx[18] Albāna mānsit[19]; nam Mettius                    {54}
  Fūfetius, dux Albānōrum, cum[20] sē invidiōsum apud cīvēs vidēret,[20]
    [[14]]
  quod[1] bellum ūnō[2] paucōrum certāmine fīnīsset, ut[3] rem
      corrigeret,
  Vēientēs Fīdēnatēsque adversus Rōmānōs concitāvit. Ipse,
  ā Tullō in[4] auxilium arcessītus, aciem in collem subdūxit, ut
      fortūnam
  bellī exspectāret et sequerētur. Quā[5] rē Tullus intellēctā      {59}
  māgnā vōce ait[6] suō illud iussū Mettium facere, ut hostēs ā tergō
  circumvenīrentur. Quō audītō hostēs territī et victī sunt. Posterō
  diē Mettius cum ad grātulandum Tullō vēnisset, iussū illīus
  quadrīgīs[7] religātus et in[8] dīversa distrāctus[9] est. Deinde
      Tullus Albam
  propter ducis perfidiam dīruit et Albānōs Rōmam trānsīre iussit.[10]

  Rōma interim crēvit[11] Albae ruīnīs[12]; duplicātus est cīvium   {65}
  numerus; mōns Caelius urbī additus et, quō[13] frequentius
  habitārētur,[13] eam[14] sēdem Tullus rēgiae cēpit ibique deinde
      habitāvit.
  Auctārum[15] vīrium fīdūciā ēlātus[16] bellum Sabīnīs indīxit.
      Pēstilentia
    [[15]]
  īnsecūta[1] est; nūlla tamen ab armīs quiēs dabātur. Crēdēbat
  enim rēx bellicōsus[2] salūbriōra mīlitiae[3] quam domī esse      {70}
  iuvenum[4] corpora, sed ipse quoque[5] diuturnō morbō est implicitus.
  Tunc vērō adeō[6] frāctī[7] simul cum corpore sunt spīritūs[8]
  illī ferōcēs, ut nūllī reī posthāc nisi sacrīs operam daret. Memorant
  Tullum fulmine[9] īctum cum domō cōnflagrāsse. Tullus
  māgnā glōriā bellī rēgnāvit annōs duōs et trīgintā.               {75}

    [Footnotes: IV (pages 10-15)

    10.16: #Mortuō Numā#: abl. abs. = _post Numae mortem_.
    10.17: #proximō rēgī#: ‘his predecessor.’ Join with #dissimilis#,
    which has the same constructions as _similis_ (p. 3, n. 12).
    _Proximus_ may mean ‘nearest (in the past)’ = ‘last,’ or ‘nearest
    (in the future)’ = ‘next.’ The context must determine the sense.
    10.18: abl. of comparison. H 471 (417): M 615: A 247: G 398:
    B 217.
    11.1: #Eō rēgnante#: ‘during his reign.’ How does this abl. abs.
    differ from those in I, lines 3, 5, 18, 37, and 40? Cf. p. xxii,
    K 1.
    11.2: _exorior_.
    11.3: #Ducibus . . . placuit#: ‘the leaders agreed that,’ etc. The
    subject of #placuit# is the clause #rem . . . fīnīrī#.
    11.4: The meanings of _rēs_ are extremely varied. Here #rem# may
    be translated ‘dispute,’ and so practically = _bellum_ above. For
    the mood of _fīnīrī_, see p. 6, n. 16.
    11.5: The abl. here denotes both the means by which and the manner
    in which the quarrel was to be ended.
    11.6: #Cum . . . rēgēs#: ‘the kings urge them.’ How literally?
    11.7: Cf. p. 1, n. 5.
    11.8: Cf. p. 6, n. 21.
    11.9: #eā lēge ut#: ‘with the understanding that,’ ‘with the
    proviso (#lēge#) that.’ The clause #ut . . . esset# expresses the
    purpose which the leaders had in mind in striking the treaty.
    11.10: Sc. _fuisset_. #unde# = _quā ex parte_. We would rather
    say, ‘_on_ which side.’ Latin often thus prefers to view an idea
    as one of _motion from_ a place where the English views it rather
    as that of _rest at_ a point. Why?
    11.11: #īnfēstī armīs#: ‘hostile in (respect of) arms,’ i.e. ‘with
    hostile arms.’
    11.12: ‘three on each side.’ Why do we give this meaning to the
    adjective?
    11.13: #māgnōrum . . . gerentēs#: ‘breathing the spirit of mighty
    armies.’ So we speak of a person as ‘a host in himself.’
    11.14: #increpuēre# describes the sound made by the spears as they
    struck the shields.
    11.15: _fulgeō_.
    11.16: = _spectātōrēs_.
    11.17: _cōnserō_.
    11.18: _cadō_.
    11.19: #Ad cāsum#: we say ‘_at_ the fall,’ but the Latin thinks of
    the shout as rising _against_ (i.e. to greet) the fall.
    11.20: _circumstō_.
    11.21: Cf. p. 5, n. 19.
    11.22: #fugam capessīvit#: ‘took (to) flight’; cf. ‘to take to
    one’s heels.’
    11.23: #singulōs per intervālla#: ‘one by one, at intervals.’
    12.1: #aliquantum spatiī#: ‘some distance.’ #spatiī# is a
    partitive genitive; #aliquantum# is an acc. of extent of space:
    H 417 (379): M 513: A 257: G 335: B 181.
    12.2: #In . . . redit# (_redeō_): ‘he turned and made a furious
    attack upon him.’ How literally?
    12.3: #inclāmat . . . ferant#: ‘was shouting . . . (bidding them)
    to bear aid.’ For #inclāmat#, see p. 3, n. 14.
    12.4: = _secundum_, as often.
    12.5: H 605, II (520, 2): M 880: A 327: G 577: B 292.
    12.6: ‘one on each side.’ Cf. _ternī_, l. 11, and note there.
    12.7: _supersum_.
    12.8: ‘equally matched.’
    12.9: #alter . . . alter#: ‘the one . . . the other (of the two).’
    With #intāctus# cf. _integer_, l. 18.
    12.10: ‘inspirited, emboldened.’
    12.11: The repetition of #fessum# gives emphasis by dwelling upon
    the fact.
    12.12: ‘was dragging,’ i.e. instead of moving with life and vigor.
    We would rather say, ‘could barely drag his body along.’ So we
    would render #male sustinentem arma#, l. 29, as ‘barely able to
    endure (the weight of) his armor.’
    12.13: = _occidit_.
    12.14: ‘as he lay prostrate.’
    12.15: #ovantēs ac grātulantēs#: ‘with rejoicing and
    congratulations.’ Participles, like adjectives, may have adverbial
    force.
    12.16: accus. of limit of motion; cf. p. 3, n. 4.
    12.17: Cf. p. 4, n. 3.
    12.18: #vīsō . . . spōnsī#: ‘when she saw her lover’s cloak,’ etc.
    Cf. p. 1, n. 4.
    12.19: #crīnēs solvere#: a common token of grief among the Romans.
    Cf. _crinibus passīs_, II, 36.
    12.20: _stringō_.
    12.21: #verbīs increpāns#: cf. _hīs increpāns verbīs_, I, 46.
    12.22: _abeō_.
    12.23: #oblīta# (_oblivīscor_) #frātrum#: ‘you who have
    forgotten,’ or ‘since you have forgotten.’ For the genitives
    #frātrum# and #patriae#, see H 454 (406, II): M 588: A 219: G 376:
    B 206, 1. Cf. the English ‘forgetful of.’ For the repetition of
    #oblīta# see n. 11.
    13.1: ‘fare, perish.’ The subject is _fēmina_, or _illa fēmina_,
    as suggested by #quaecumque#. How? With the whole sentence cf.
    _Sīc . . . mea_, I, 47, and see note there.
    13.2: #facinus#, by its derivation from _faciō_, properly =
    ‘a deed,’ whether good or bad, but generally ‘a crime.’
    13.3: = _senātōribus_, who were officially styled _Patrēs
    Cōnscrīptī_. #patribus plēbīque# virtually = _omnibus_.
    13.4: ‘court.’
    13.5: See Vocab., _līctor_.
    13.6: The tense has dramatic force and = ‘was (actually)
    putting on.’
    13.7: _caedō_.
    13.8: _amplector_.
    13.9: clause of negative purpose: see p. 9, n. 6.
    13.10: _cōnspiciō_. The subjunctive may be explained (1) as caused
    by attraction to #faceret#, H 652, 1 (529, II): M 793: A 342:
    G 663: B 324, or (2) as in informal indir. disc.
    13.11: abl. of separation (cf. p. 1, n. 6), to be joined with
    #orbum faceret#, which = _orbāret_.
    13.12: After a negative clause the Romans often use _que_ or _et_,
    where the English idiom requires _but_.
    13.13: why abl.? see p. 4, n. 1.
    13.14: Cf. p. 6, n. 21.
    13.15: ‘a (certain) street.’ The street referred to ran up the
    slope of the Esquiline Hill.
    13.16: See Vocab., _iugum_. The father of Horatius, by making him
    pass, as it were, beneath the yoke, symbolically executed the
    sentence of death passed by the judges.
    13.17: Sc. _Tigillum_. Livy says that this beam was renewed from
    time to time at public expense, even down to his own day. Another
    memorial of this fight was the _Pīla_ (‘Column’) _Horātia_,
    adjoining the Forum, on which Horatius is said to have hung the
    spoils taken from the Curiatii.
    13.18: #pāx Albāna# = _pāx cum Albā īcta_.
    13.19: _maneō_.
    13.20: #cum . . . vidēret#: subjunctive of cause. See p. 2, n. 13;
    p. 4, n. 12; and p. xx, H 2.
    14.1: #quod . . . fīnīsset#: ‘because (as they said),’ etc. The
    subjunctive is due to the implied indirect discourse, and
    expresses the thought, not of the writer, but of Mettius’
    subjects. See p. xxi, H 4.
    14.2: #ūnō . . . certāmine#: ‘by one contest (only), and that a
    contest in which but few fought.’ Cf. l. 4.
    14.3: #ut . . . corrigeret#: ‘to set the matter straight,’ i.e. to
    regain the good will of his people. Join this clause with what
    follows.
    14.4: #in auxilium#: ‘to give aid,’ an expression of purpose.
    Cf. _ad supplicium_, I, 29, and note. Tullus summoned Mettius
    in accordance with the treaty made before the fight between the
    Horatii and the Curiatii (l. 7).
    14.5: #Quā rē . . . intellēctā# (_intellegō_): ‘when he noticed
    this state of things.’ For #quā#, see p. 4, n. 3.
    14.6: #ait . . . circumvenīrentur#: Tullus’ purpose in making this
    statement was partly to frighten the enemy, partly to reassure his
    own men. Livy relates that Tullus had stationed his own forces
    against the Veientes, the Albans against the Fidenates. The
    withdrawal of Mettius exposed the flank of the Romans to attack
    from the Fidenates, and so was regarded at once by the Romans as
    proof of treachery.
    14.7: abl. of separation (cf. p. 1, n. 6). _ligāre_ and its
    compounds are construed with either (1) the simple ablative, or
    (2) the ablative with _ab_, _dē_, or _ex_.
    14.8: #in . . . est#: ‘was torn limb from limb.’
    14.9: _distrahō_.
    14.10: _iubeō_.
    14.11: _crēscō_.
    14.12: abl. of means.
    14.13: #quō . . . habitārētur#: ‘that it might be more densely
    inhabited,’ i.e. that a larger number of people might be induced
    to live there. In purpose clauses containing a comparative, _quō_
    is used instead of _ut_: H 568, 7 (497, 2): M 909: A 317, _b_:
    G 545, 2; B 282, _a_. This _quō_ is the abl. sing. neut. of the
    relative pronoun, and = _ut eō_, ‘that thereby.’
    14.14: #eam . . . cēpit# (_capiō_): ‘Tullus chose it (the
    mountain) as the site of his palace,’ Why is #eam# feminine,
    although referring to _mōns Caelius_, which is masculine? Cf.
    p. 5, n. 14.
    14.15: #Auctārum . . . fīdūciā#: ‘because of the confidence
    (begotten) of his increased strength,’ or ‘by his confidence in
    his increased strength.’ In the former case the gen. is
    subjective; in the latter it is objective; H 440, 1 and 2 (396, II
    and III): M 553, 571: A 213, 1, 2: G 363, 1 and 2: B 199, 200.
    14.16: _efferō_.
    15.1: _īnsequor_.
    15.2: #bellicōsus# = a causal clause _quod ipse bellicōsus erat_.
    15.3: #mīlitiae quam domī#: ‘in war than in peace.’ See H 484, 2
    (426, 2): M 622: A 258, _d_: G. 411, R. 2: B 232, 2; xvi, A 1.
    15.4: = ‘the fighting men,’ because _iuvenēs_ (men under 45) were
    eligible for military duty.
    15.5: #sed ipse quoque#: ‘but (i.e. in spite of this statement) he
    too.’
    15.6: ‘so completely.’
    15.7: _frangō_.
    15.8: #spīritūs illī ferōcēs#: ‘that high spirit of his’; #illī# =
    ‘that for which he was so famous.’ Cf. l. 2.
    15.9: #fulmine īctum . . . cōnflagrāsse# = _fulmine īctum esse et
    cōnflagrāsse_. Instead of using two coördinated verbs with a
    common subject, Latin regularly represents the first verb by a
    perf. pass. part., or by the past part. of a deponent verb, in
    agreement with that common subject. Cf. p. 2, n. 8, and p. xxiv,
    L 5.]

Tullo mortuo Ancum Marcium regem populus creavit. Numae Pompilii nepos
Ancus Marcius erat, aequitate et religione avo similis. Tunc Latini, cum
quibus Tullo regnante ictum foedus erat, sustulerant animos, et
incursionem in agrum Romanum fecerunt. Ancus, priusquam eis bellum
indiceret, legatum misit, qui res repeteret, eumque morem posteri
acceperunt. Id autem hoc modo fiebat. Legatus, ubi ad fines eorum venit
a quibus res repetuntur, capite velato “Audi, Iuppiter,” inquit “audite,
fines huius populi. Ego sum publicus nuntius populi Romani; verbis meis
fides sit.” Deinde peragit postulata. Si non deduntur res quas exposcit,
hastam in fines hostium emittit bellumque ita indicit. Legatus, qui ea
de re mittitur, _Fetialis_ ritusque belli indicendi _Ius Fetiale_
appellatur.

Legato Romano res repetenti superbe responsum est a Latinis; quare
bellum hoc modo eis indictum est. Ancus, exercitu conscripto, profectus
Latinos fudit et compluribus oppidis deletis cives Romam traduxit. Cum
autem in tanta hominum multitudine facinora clandestina fierent, Ancus
carcerem in media urbe ad terrorem increscentis audaciae aedificavit.
Idem nova moenia urbi circumdedit, Ianiculum montem ponte sublicio in
Tiberi facto urbi coniunxit, in ore Tiberis Ostiam urbem condidit.
Pluribus aliis rebus intra paucos annos confectis; immatura morte
praereptus obiit.

    [Footnotes: V (pages 15-17)

    15.10: What is the force of this abl. abs.?
    15.11: #rēgem populus creāvit#: This phrase, as it stands, is
    somewhat misleading. As a matter of fact, the kingship was neither
    hereditary nor elective. On the death of a king an _interrēx_, or
    regent, was chosen, who took the auspices, and the augurs inferred
    from the signs that the gods favored a certain candidate. He was
    then elected by the Assembly, and the choice was confirmed by the
    Senate.
    15.12: abl. of specification.
    15.13: #sustulerant# (_tollō_) #animōs#: ‘had plucked up courage.’
    15.14: Cf. _priusquam . . . posset_, IV, 25, and note.
    15.15: #quī . . . repeteret#: relative clause of purpose. _Rēs
    repetere_ = ‘to demand the (stolen) things,’ is a technical phrase
    of war, and = ‘to demand restitution or satisfaction.’ The
    opposite is _rēs reddere_, or _rēs dēdere_, as in l. 13.
    16.1: #eum mōrem . . . accēpērunt#: ‘that custom posterity (the
    Romans of later times) adopted.’ Traces of the custom appear as
    late as the reign of Augustus.
    16.2: While praying, the Romans covered their faces with a fold of
    the toga, that no untoward sight might interrupt their devotions.
    The _lēgātus_ here covers his face, because he is praying to
    Jupiter and to the #fīnēs#, which are personified.
    16.3: This word, rather than _dīxit_, is used with direct
    discourse, and regularly stands, as here, _within_ the quotation.
    16.4: The _lēgātus_, of course, said _fīnēs Albānōrum_, or
    _Vēientium_, as the case might be.
    16.5: ‘official,’ i.e. duly accredited.
    16.6: #verbīs . . . sit# = _verbīs meīs crēdite_. Cf. II, 48, _cuī
    reī fidem fēcit_. #sit# is a hortatory subjunctive; H 559, 1
    (484, II): M 713: A 266: G 263: B 274.
    16.7: See Vocab., _fētiālis_.
    16.8: #respōnsum . . . Latīnīs# = _Latīnī respondērunt_. The
    impersonal passive is common.
    16.9: #hōc#: ‘described _above_,’ in lines 9-16. In l. 9 _hōc_ =
    ‘described _below_.’ _Hīc_ more often bears the latter sense, i.e.
    it refers to what follows.
    16.10: #profectus . . . fūdit# (_fundō_): cf. p. 15, n. 9.
    16.11: ‘transferred, removed.’
    16.12: #Cum . . . fierent#: a causal clause; cf. p. 13, n. 20.
    16.13: See Vocab., _carcer_.
    16.14: #ad . . . audāciae# = _ut incrēscentem audāciam terrēret_.
    Cf. p. 3, n. 8, and _ad congressum deae_, III, 33. #audāciae# is
    objective genitive: cf. p. 14, n. 15.
    16.15: #ponte subliciō#: abl. abs., with #factō#, expressing
    means. This bridge, the earliest and most famous of the bridges
    over the Tiber, derived its name from the circumstance that it was
    always made of wood and supported on piles (_sublicae_). It is
    this bridge that figures so largely in Macaulay’s _Lays of Ancient
    Rome_, Horatius, stanzas xxix. ff.
    17.1: #in ōre#: ‘at the mouth.’ The town Ostia got its name from
    its position _in ōre Tiberis_. It was the port of Rome, and thus
    attained great importance. Great harbors were built there in the
    days of the Empire, the remains of which, as well as of the
    warehouses built for the storage of merchandise from abroad, are
    still visible.]


#VI. Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, Romanorum rex quintus# [[stripped text]]

616-578 B.C.

Anco regnante Lucius Tarquinius, Tarquiniis, ex Etruriae urbe,
profectus, cum coniuge et fortunis omnibus Romam commigravit. Additur
haec fabula: advenienti aquila pilleum sustulit et super carpentum, cui
Tarquinius insidebat, cum magno clangore volitans rursus capiti apte
reposuit; inde sublimis abiit. Tanaquil coniux, caelestium prodigiorum
perita, regnum ei portendi intellexit; itaque, virum complexa, excelsa
et alta sperare eum iussit. Has spes cogitationesque secum portantes
urbem ingressi sunt, domicilioque ibi comparato Tarquinius pecunia et
industria dignitatem atque etiam Anci regis familiaritatem consecutus
est; a quo tutor liberis relictus regnum intercepit et ita
administravit, quasi iure adeptus esset.

Tarquinius Priscus Latinos bello domuit; Circum Maximum aedificavit; de
Sabinis triumphavit; murum lapideum urbi circumdedit. Equitum centurias
duplicavit, nomina mutare non potuit, deterritus, ut ferunt, Atti Navii
auctoritate. Attus enim, ea tempestate augur inclitus, id fieri posse
negabat, nisi aves addixissent; iratus rex in experimentum artis eum
interrogavit, fierine posset quod ipse mente concepisset; Attus augurio
acto fieri posse respondit. “Atqui hoc” inquit rex “agitabam, num cotem
illam secare novacula possem.” “Potes ergo” inquit augur, et rex
secuisse dicitur. Tarquinius filium tredecim annorum, quod in proelio
hostem percussisset, praetexta bullaque donavit; unde haec ingenuorum
puerorum insignia esse coeperunt.

Supererant duo Anci filii, qui, aegre ferentes se paterno regno
fraudatos esse, regi insidias paraverunt. Ex pastoribus duos
ferocissimos deligunt ad patrandum facinus. Ei simulata rixa in
vestibulo regiae tumultuantur. Quorum clamor cum penitus in regiam
pervenisset, vocati ad regem pergunt. Primo uterque vociferari coepit et
certatim alter alteri obstrepere. Cum vero iussi essent in vicem dicere,
unus ex composito rem orditur; dumque intentus in eum se rex totus
avertit, alter elatam securim in eius caput deiecit, et relicto in
vulnere telo ambo foras se proripiunt.

  Ancō rēgnante Lūcius Tarquinius, Tarquiniīs,[2] ex Etrūriae urbe,
  profectus,[3] cum coniuge et fortūnīs omnibus Rōmam commigrāvit.
  Additur haec fābula: advenientī[4] aquila pilleum sustulit[5] et super

    [Footnotes: VI (pages 17-19)

    17.2: #Tarquiniīs . . . urbe#: ‘from Tarquinii, a city of
    Etruria.’ Cf. p. 8, n. 5.
    17.3: _proficīscor_.
    17.4: Sc. _Rōmam_: ‘while on his way to Rome.’ The participle
    agrees with _eī_ understood, which is a dat. of separation, or
    disadvantage, with #sustulit#: H 427 (385, 2): M 539: A 229:
    G 345, R. 1: B 188, 2, _d_.
    17.5: _tollō_.
    17.6: A two-wheeled carriage, with curtains and an awning.
    17.7: #cuī#: ‘in which.’ Why dat.?
    17.8: #rūrsus . . . reposuit#: since _repōnō_ = ‘to put _back_,’
    or ‘to place _again_,’ #rūrsus# is unnecessary.
    17.9: More often _repōnō_ is followed by _in_ with the abl., or
    the acc.
    17.10: #sublīmis abiit#: ‘flew high up in the air and departed.’
    17.11: #caelestium . . . perīta#: ‘skilled in (interpreting)
    portents from heaven.’ The Romans regarded the Etruscans as
    exceptionally skillful in such matters. For the gen., see H 451, 1
    (399, I, 2). M 573: A 218, _a_: G 374: B 204, 1.
    17.12: #rēgnum eī portendī intellēxit#: ‘perceived that the sign
    indicated that he was to be king.’ How literally? According to
    Livy, the significance of the omen lay in these facts: It came
    from a favorable quarter of the sky (which, to the Romans, was the
    east); it concerned his _head_, the _supreme_ part of his being;
    hence the removal of his cap by the eagle, the bird of Jupiter,
    ‘king of gods and men,’ and its restoration, implied that his
    _cap_ was to be removed and replaced by a _crown_.
    17.13: neuter plural adjectives, used as nouns: ‘an exalted
    destiny.’
    18.1: _ingredior_.
    18.2: _cōnsequor_.
    18.3: _relinquō_.
    18.4: H 584 (513, II): M 944, 945: A 312, and N. 1: G 602 and R.:
    B 307.
    18.5: _adipīscor_.
    18.6: #Circum Māximum#: see map, p. xxviii. In its final form it
    could accommodate nearly 300,000 spectators. The Romans of the
    Empire were passionately devoted to the chariot races of the
    circus. For a good description of a Roman circus, see Lew
    Wallace’s _Ben Hur_, Book V, Chap. XII.
    18.7: #dē Sabīnīs triumphāvit#: ‘he triumphed over’; lit., ‘he got
    a triumph out of.’ See Vocab., _triumphus_.
    18.8: #mūrum . . . circumdedit#: ‘he built a stone wall round the
    city.’ According to Livy, the wall was merely begun by Tarquin and
    finished by his successor, Servius Tullius.
    18.9: Cf. II, 42. Livy says that when Romulus formed the three
    centuries of horsemen he called one _Ramnēs_, after his own name,
    another _Titiēnsēs_, after King Tatius. Tarquin desired to name
    the new centuries after himself.
    18.10: = _tempore_.
    18.11: #nisi . . . addīxissent#: ‘unless the birds gave consent,’
    i.e. without taking the _auspicia_ and finding them favorable. Cf.
    I, 42. The subjunctive is due to the indirect discourse. For the
    tense, see p. 6, n. 1.
    18.12: #in experīmentum artis#: ‘to test his art.’ Cf. p. 14,
    n. 4.
    18.13: Cf. Cf.] p. 3, n. 2.
    18.14: Cf. p. 6, n. 1. The king said ‘_Potestne fierī quod in
    mente concēpī?_’
    18.15: #hōc# is emphatic, ‘Ah, but what I had in mind was _this_.’
    18.16: #Potes ergō#: ‘well, you can.’
    18.17: descriptive gen.: H 440, 3 (396, V): M 558: A 215: G 365:
    B 203.
    18.18: Cf. p. 14, n. 1.
    18.19: Sc. _togā_.
    19.1: See Vocab., _bulla_.
    19.2: = _ex quō_: ‘in consequence of this circumstance.’
    19.3: Cf. p. 5, n. 14, and p. 16, n. 9.
    19.4: ‘were still alive.’
    19.5: = _patris_. Cf. the use of _rēgius_, I, 17.
    19.6: The infinitive depends on #aegrē ferentēs#. Phrases
    expressive of emotion, whether of joy or of sorrow, are often
    followed by the infinitive with subject accus.
    19.7: Cf. p. 4, n. 3.
    19.8: The conjunction of the subordinate clause is often preceded
    by one or two words, sometimes by a larger number.
    19.9: #certātim . . . obstrepere#: ‘to (try to) drown each other’s
    voices’; lit., ‘in eager rivalry to make noise one against (_ob_)
    the other.’ Why is _alterī_ dative?
    19.10: #ex compositō#: ‘according to previous agreement.’
    19.11: #ēlātam secūrim . . . dēiēcit# = _extulit_ (‘raised’) _et
    dēiēcit_. Cf. p. 2, n. 8.
    19.12: #relīctō . . . tēlō#: we say, ‘leaving the weapon--they
    flee,’ i.e. we treat the two actions as simultaneous. The Romans
    say more exactly: ‘having left--they flee,’ i.e. the act of
    leaving is viewed as prior to that of flight.]


#VII. Servius Tullius, Romanorum rex sextus# [[stripped text]]

578-534 B.C.

Post hunc Servius Tullius suscepit imperium, genitus ex nobili femina,
captiva tamen et famula. Qui cum in domo Tarquinii Prisci educaretur,
ferunt prodigium visu eventuque mirabile accidisse. Flammae species
pueri dormientis caput amplexa est. Hoc visu Tanaquil summam ei
dignitatem portendi intellexit coniugique suasit ut eum haud secus ac
suos liberos educaret. Is postquam adolevit, et fortitudine et consilio
insignis fuit. In proelio quodam, in quo rex Tarquinius adversus Sabinos
conflixit, militibus segnius dimicantibus, raptum signum in hostem
misit. Cuius recipiendi gratia Romani tam acriter pugnaverunt, ut et
signum et victoriam referrent. Quare a Tarquinio gener adsumptus est; et
cum Tarquinius occisus esset, Tanaquil, Tarquinii uxor, mortem eius
celavit, populumque ex superiore parte aedium adlocuta ait regem grave
quidem, sed non letale vulnus accepisse, eumque petere, ut interim dum
convalesceret, Servio Tullio dicto audientes essent. Sic Servius Tullius
regnare coepit, sed recte imperium administravit. Sabinos subegit;
montes tres, Quirinalem, Viminalem, Esquilinum urbi adiunxit; fossas
circa murum duxit. Idem censum ordinavit, et populum in classes et
centurias distribuit.

Servius Tullius aliquod urbi decus addere volebat. Iam tum inclitum erat
Dianae Ephesiae fanum. Id communiter a civitatibus Asiae factum fama
ferebat. Itaque Latinorum populis suasit ut et ipsi fanum Dianae cum
populo Romano Romae in Aventino monte aedificarent. Quo facto, bos mirae
magnitudinis cuidam Latino nata dicitur, et responsum somnio datum eum
populum summam imperii habiturum, cuius civis bovem illam Dianae
immolasset. Latinus bovem ad fanum Dianae egit et causam sacerdoti
Romano exposuit. Ille callidus dixit prius eum vivo flumine manus
abluere debere. Latinus dum ad Tiberim descendit, sacerdos bovem
immolavit. Ita imperium civibus sibique gloriam adquisivit.

Servius Tullius filiam alteram ferocem, mitem alteram habens, cum
Tarquinii filios pari esse animo videret, ferocem miti, mitem feroci in
matrimonium dedit, ne duo violenta ingenia matrimonio iungerentur. Sed
mites seu forte seu fraude perierunt; feroces morum similitudo
coniunxit. Statim Tarquinius a Tullia incitatus advocato senatu regnum
paternum repetere coepit. Qua re audita Servius dum ad Curiam contendit,
iussu Tarquinii per gradus deiectus et domum refugiens interfectus est.
Tullia carpento vecta in Forum properavit et coniugem e Curia evocatum
prima regem salutavit; cuius iussu cum e turba ac tumultu decessisset
domumque rediret, viso patris corpore, cunctantem et frena mulionem
inhibentem super ipsum corpus carpentum agere iussit, unde vicus ille
Sceleratus dictus est. Servius Tullius regnavit annos quattuor et
quadraginta.

    19.13: Livy relates that at the capture of the Latin town
    Corniculum, Servius’ father was killed and his mother taken
    prisoner. Out of respect to her high rank, Tanaquil set her free
    and welcomed her to the palace. There Servius was born, and he was
    brought up in Tarquin’s household.
    19.14: #ferunt . . . accidisse#: in English, the verb
    corresponding to #ferunt# would be parenthetical, thus:
    ‘a prodigy, _they say_, happened.’
    19.15: #prōdigium . . . mīrābile#: ‘a prodigy, strange to look
    upon, and marvelously fulfilled.’ #vīsū# and #ēventū# are
    ablatives of specification to #mīrābile#: H 480 (424): M 650:
    A 253: G 397: B 226, 1.
    20.1: #Flammae speciēs#: ‘the semblance of fire.’ We may render
    the whole sentence, ‘Fire seemed to envelop,’ etc.
    20.2: #summam . . . intellēxit#: cf. p. 17, n. 12.
    20.3: Cf. p. 1, n. 5.
    20.4: governed by _ēducābat_ understood.
    20.5: _quīdam_ and _ūnus_ often have no more force than the
    English indefinite article.
    20.6: #mīlitibus . . . dīmicantibus#: causal.
    20.7: #raptum . . . mīsit#: cf. p. 2, n. 8. To lose the standard
    was as much of a disgrace then as it is now to lose the flag.
    20.8: #Cūius . . . grātiā#: an expression of purpose = _quod ut
    reciperet_.
    20.9: Roman houses in general had no windows on the ground floor.

    B 187, II. #dictō# is dat. with #audientēs#, which here itself =
    ‘obeying.’
    20.13: i.e. instead of being formally chosen king by the senate
    and people (p. 15, n. 11).
    20.14: _subigō_.
    20.15: #fossās . . . dūxit#: this statement harmonizes with VI,
    14: see note there. Remains of the wall and ditch are extant,
    especially along the east side of the Esquiline, Viminal, and
    Quirinal hills.
    20.16: The census was not, as with us, a mere enumeration of the
    inhabitants, but an enrollment and classification of them
    according to property for purposes of taxation and military
    service. Hence the clause #in . . . distribuit# is in part an
    explanation of #cēnsum ōrdināvit#.
    20.17: These classes were six in number.
    20.18: According to Livy, there were 193 centuries. At elections
    each century cast a single vote, the opinion of the majority of
    its members being regarded as the voice of the whole century. The
    first, or richest class, contained 98 centuries, and so controlled
    98 votes, more than a majority.
    21.1: #Iam tum#: ‘even in those early days.’
    21.2: This temple was one of the seven wonders of the ancient
    world. See Acts xix, 24 f.
    21.3: #commūniter . . . factum# (_esse_): ‘that the states of Asia
    had united in building it.’ How literally?
    21.4: #et ipsī# = _etiam ipsī_, or _ipsī quoque_: ‘they too,’ i.e.
    as well as the _cīvitātēs Asiae_.
    21.5: ‘in conjunction with.’ The whole might have been expressed
    thus: _ut illī_ (i.e. the _Latīnī_) _et populus Rōmānus . . .
    aedificārent_. Cf. lines 23, 24.
    21.6: #Quō factō# = _postquam hōc_ (i.e. the building of the
    temple) _factum est_.
    21.7: Cf. p. 18, n. 17.
    21.8: Sc. _esse_. For the personal construction #dīcitur#, see
    H 611, 1 (534, I and N. 1): M 962: A 330, _b_, 1: G 528, 1: B 332.
    21.9: Subjunctive, because in a subordinate clause of indir. disc.
    For the tense, cf. p. 6, n. 1.
    21.10: ‘_The_ (aforesaid) Latin,’ mentioned in l. 28. This is one
    of the cases where Latin suffers from the lack of the definite
    article.
    21.11: ‘cunningly.’ Cf. p. 4, n. 4.
    21.12: The Tiber ran close to the foot of the Aventine hill on
    which (l. 26) the temple of Diana stood.
    21.13: = _cum habēret_, ‘since he had.’ #cum . . . vidēret# is
    also causal.

    of these two pairs of words is the reverse of that in the first.
    Cf. l. 36, _alteram ferōcem, mītem alteram_. This arrangement is
    called _Chiasmus_: H 666, 2 (562): M 1150: A 344, _f_, and N.:
    G 682, and R.: B 350, II, _c_).
    22.1: The daughter of Tullius.

    returning.’
    22.6: #super ipsum corpus#: ‘over the _very_ body’; #ipsum#
    emphasizes the wickedness of Tullia. Roman feeling usually
    required that the utmost respect be shown to the bodies of the
    dead.

#VIII. Tarquinius Superbus, Romanorum rex septimus et ultimus#
[[stripped text]]

534-510 B.C.

Tarquinius Superbus regnum sceleste occupavit. Tamen bello strenuus
Latinos Sabinosque domuit. Urbem Gabios in potestatem redegit fraude
Sexti filii. Is cum indigne ferret eam urbem a patre expugnari non
posse, ad Gabinos se contulit, patris saevitiam in se conquerens.
Benigne a Gabinis exceptus paulatim eorum benevolentiam consequitur,
fictis blanditiis ita eos adliciens, ut apud omnes plurimum posset, et
ad postremum dux belli eligeretur. Tum e suis unum ad patrem mittit
sciscitatum quidnam se facere vellet. Pater nuntio filii nihil
respondit, sed velut deliberabundus in hortum transiit ibique inambulans
sequente nuntio altissima papaverum capita baculo decussit. Nuntius,
fessus exspectando, rediit Gabios. Sextus, cognito silentio patris et
facto, intellexit quid vellet pater. Primores civitatis interemit
patrique urbem sine ulla dimicatione tradidit.

Postea rex Ardeam urbem obsidebat. Ibi cum in castris essent, Tarquinius
Collatinus, sorore regis natus, forte cenabat apud Sextum Tarquinium cum
iuvenibus regiis. Incidit de uxoribus mentio; cum suam unusquisque
laudaret, placuit experiri. Itaque citatis equis Romam avolant; regias
nurus in convivio et luxu deprehendunt. Pergunt inde Collatiam;
Lucretiam, Collatini uxorem, inter ancillas lanae deditam inveniunt. Ea
ergo ceteris praestare iudicatur. Paucis interiectis diebus Sextus
Collatiam rediit et Lucretiae vim attulit. Illa postero die,
advocatispatre et coniuge, rem exposuit et se cultro, quem sub veste
abditum habebat, occidit. Conclamat vir paterque et in exitium regum
coniurant. Tarquinio Romam redeunti clausae sunt urbis portae et
exsilium indictum.

In antiquis annalibus memoriae haec sunt prodita. Anus hospita atque
incognita ad Tarquinium quondam Superbum regem adiit, novem libros
ferens, quos esse dicebat divina oracula: eos se velle venumdare.
Tarquinius pretium percontatus est: mulier nimium atque immensum
poposcit. Rex, quasi anus aetate desiperet, derisit. Tum illa foculum
cum igni apponit et tres libros ex novem deurit; et, ecquid reliquos sex
eodem pretio emere vellet, regem interrogavit. Sed Tarquinius id multo
risit magis, dixitque anum iam procul dubio delirare. Mulier ibidem
statim tres alios libros exussit; atque id ipsum denuo placide rogat, ut
tres reliquos eodem illo pretio emat. Tarquinius ore iam serio atque
attentiore animo fit; eam constantiam confidentiamque non neglegendam
intellegit: libros tres reliquos mercatur nihilo minore pretio quam quod
erat petitum pro omnibus. Sed eam mulierem tunc a Tarquinio digressam
postea nusquam loci visam constitit. Libri tres in sacrario conditi
Sibyllinique appellati. Ad eos, quasi ad oraculum, Quindecemviri adeunt,
cum dii immortales publice consulendi sunt.

    22.8: Cf. the whole description VII, 40-53.
    22.9: not ‘occupied.’
    22.10: The infinitive depends on #indīgnē ferret#, an expression
    of emotion. Cf. p. 19, n. 6.
    23.1: #plūrimum posset#: ‘he possessed great influence.’
    #plūrimum# is an accusative of extent.

    23.11: #citātīs equīs#: ‘at top speed.’ How literally?
    23.12: #rēgiās nurūs#: ‘the king’s daughters-in-law,’ i.e. the

    23.13: #convīviō et lūxū#: ‘a banquet and luxury’ = ‘a luxurious
    banquet.’
    23.14: The home of Collatinus.
    23.15: #lānae dēditam#: ‘wholly intent on spinning.’ In the
    oldest times the Roman housewife made all the garments of the
    household. Hence a frequent laudatory inscription on the
    tombstones of Roman ladies is _lānam fēcit_. Macaulay had this
    feature of Roman life in mind when (_Horatius_, stanza LXX) he
    wrote:
        “When the goodwife’s shuttle merrily
          Goes flashing through the loom.”

    maidens devoted to the worship of Apollo. The most famous, from
    whom Tarquin was believed to have received the Sibylline books,
    lived at Cumae, on the coast of Campania, in Italy. The books were
    placed in a vault beneath the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. When
    this temple was burned in 83 B.C., the senate sent envoys to
    Greece to make a new collection of oracular sayings. These also
    were deposited for a time in the temple of Jupiter after its
    restoration.]

Iunius Brutus, sorore Tarquinii Superbi natus, cum eandem fortunam

Profectus Delphos cum Tarquinii filiis, quos pater ad Apollinem

potestatem habiturum, qui primus matrem osculatus esset. Tunc Brutus,
velut si casu prolapsus cecidisset, terram osculatus est, scilicet quod
ea communis mater omnium mortalium esset.

Collatinus Lucretiae maritus. At libertas modo parta per dolum et
proditionem paene amissa est. Erant in iuventute Romana adulescentes
aliquot, sodales adulescentium Tarquiniorum. Hi cum legatis, quos rex ad
bona sua repetenda Romam miserat, de restituendis regibus conloquuntur,
ipsos Bruti consulis filios in societatem consilii adsumunt. Sermonem
eorum ex servis unus excepit; rem ad consules detulit. Datae ad
Tarquinium litterae manifestum facinus fecerunt. Proditores in vincula
coniecti sunt, deinde damnati. Stabant ad palum deligati iuvenes
nobilissimi; sed a ceteris liberi consulis omnium in se oculos
avertebant. Consules in sedem processere suam, missique lictores nudatos
virgis caedunt securique feriunt. Supplicii non spectator modo, sed et
exactor erat Brutus, qui tunc patrem exuit, ut consulem ageret.

Tarquinius deinde bello aperto regnum reciperare conatus est. Equitibus
praeerat Aruns, Tarquinii filius: rex ipse cum legionibus sequebatur.
Obviam hosti consules eunt; Brutus ad explorandum cum equitatu
antecessit. Aruns, ubi procul Brutum agnovit, inflammatus ira “Ille est
vir” inquit “qui nos patria expulit; ipse en ille nostris decoratus
insignibus magnifice incedit.” Tum concitat calcaribus equum atque in
ipsum consulem dirigit; Brutus avide se certamini offert. Adeo infestis
animis concurrerunt, ut ambo hasta transfixi caderent; fugatus tamen
proelio est Tarquinius. Alter consul Romam triumphans rediit. Bruti
conlegae funus, quanto potuit apparatu, fecit. Brutum matronae, ut
parentem, annum luxerunt.

    Romulus) till their city was completely destroyed in 396 B.C.

    #id . . . gerere#. #Fabiōs# is strongly opposed to #vōs#.
    28.1: #comitante . . . āgmine#: ‘the Fabii accompanying him in a
    body.’ How literally?
    28.2: #ad . . . ferunt#: so we ‘laud a person to the skies.’
    28.3: #Numquam . . . neque . . . neque#: in Latin, as in English,
    two negatives neutralize each other and make an affirmative. To
    this law there are two regular exceptions in Latin: When a general
    negative like _nōn_, _numquam_, or _nēmō_ is followed (1) by
    _neque . . . neque_ or (2) by the emphatic _nē . . . quidem_. In
    the former case the negation is distributed by the _neque . . .
    neque_ into two (or more) clauses or phrases; in the latter, the
    full weight of the negation is concentrated upon a single word or
    phrase. In English a single negative is always to be employed.

    especially frequent with phrases consisting of a gerundive and a

    28.7: #Vēientēs . . . paenituisset#: lit., ‘when it had repented
    the V. of the peace which they had secured.’ What is our idiom?
    #paenituisset# is wholly impersonal; #Vēientēs# is acc., though
    logically its subject, and #pācis# is gen., though logically its

Anno trecentesimo ab urbe condita pro duobus consulibus decemviri creati
sunt, qui adlatas e Graecia leges populo proponerent. Duodecim tabulis
eae sunt perscriptae. Ceterum decemviri sua ipsorum insolentia in
exitium acti sunt. Nam unus ex iis Appius Claudius virginem plebeiam
adamavit. Quam cum Appius non posset pretio ac spe perlicere, unum e
clientibus subornavit, qui eam in servitutem deposceret, facile victurum
se sperans, cum ipse esset et accusator et iudex. Lucius Virginius,
puellae pater, tunc aberat militiae causa. Cliens igitur virgini
venienti in Forum (namque ibi in tabernis litterarum ludi erant) iniecit
manum, adfirmans suam esse servam. Eam sequi se iubet; ni faciat,
minatur se vi abstracturum. Pavida puella stupente, ad clamorem nutricis
fit concursus. Itaque cum ille puellam vi non posset abducere, eam vocat
in ius, ipso Appio iudice.

Interea missi nuntii ad Virginium properant. Is commeatu sumpto a
castris profectus prima luce Romam advenit, cum iam civitas in Foro

civium opem implorans filiam suam deducit. Neque eo setius Appius, cum
in tribunal escendisset, Virginiam clienti suo addixit. Tum pater, ubi
nihil usquam auxilii vidit, “Quaeso,” inquit “Appi, ignosce patrio
dolori; sine me filiam ultimum adloqui.” Data venia pater cum filiam
seduxisset, ab lanio cultro adrepto pectus puellae transfigit. Tum vero
sibi viam facit et respersus cruore ad exercitum profugit et milites ad
vindicandum facinus accendit. Concitatus exercitus montem Aventinum
insedit; decem tribunos militum creavit; decemviros magistratu se
abdicare coegit eosque omnes aut morte aut exilio multavit; ipse Appius

    451 B.C.
    29.2: Cf. p. 5, n. 15.
    29.3: #quī . . . prōpōnerent#: i.e. after studying the laws of
    Greece, they were to draw up a code and submit it to the people.

    29.6: abl. of means; we say ‘_on_ tablets.’ The tablets were of
    bronze. For many centuries Roman schoolboys had to commit these
    laws to memory.
    29.7: The Decemvirs had been elected for one year, at the end of
    which time they reported their work still unfinished, and a second
    board was chosen. The story that follows concerns the second
    board. All accounts agree that the rule of the first board was in

#XIII. Titus Manlius Torquatus# [[stripped text]]

Titus Manlius ob ingenii et linguae tarditatem a patre rūs relegatus
erat. Qui cum audivisset patri diem dictam esse a Pomponio, tribuno
plebis, cepit consilium rudis quidem et agrestis animi, sed pietate
laudabile. Cultro succinctus mane in urbem atque a porta confestim ad
Pomponium pergit: introductus cultrum stringit et super lectum Pomponii
stans se eum transfixurum minatur, nisi ab incepta accusatione desistat.
Pavidus tribunus, quippe qui cerneret ferrum ante oculos micans,
accusationem dimisit. Ea res adulescenti eo maiori fuit honori quod
animum eius acerbitas paterna a pietate non avertisset, ideoque eodem
anno tribunus militum factus est.

Cum postea Galli ad tertium lapidem trans Anienem fluvium castra
posuissent, exercitus Romanus ab urbe profectus in citeriore ripa fluvii
constitit. Pons in medio erat: tunc Gallus eximia corporis magnitudine
in vacuum pontem processit et quam maxima voce potuit “Quem nunc” inquit
“Roma fortissimum habet, is procedat agedum ad pugnam, ut eventus
certaminis nostri ostendat utra gens bello sit melior.” Diu inter
primores iuvenum Romanorum silentium fuit. Tum Titus Manlius ex statione
ad imperatorem pergit: “Iniussu tuo,” inquit, “imperator, extra ordinem
numquam pugnaverim, non si certam victoriam videam; si tu permittis,
volo ego illi beluae ostendere me ex ea familia ortum esse, quae
Gallorum agmen ex rupe Tarpeia deiecit.” Cui imperator “Macte virtute,”
inquit “Tite Manli, esto: perge et nomen Romanum invictum praesta.”

Armant deinde iuvenem aequales: scutum capit, Hispano cingitur gladio,
ad propiorem pugnam habili. Exspectabat eum Gallus stolide laetus et
linguam ab inrisu exserens. Ubi constitere inter duas acies, Gallus
ensem cum ingenti sonitu in arma Manlii deiecit. Manlius vero inter
corpus et arma Galli sese insinuans uno alteroque ictu ventrem
transfodit et in spatium ingens ruentem porrexit hostem; iacenti torquem
detraxit, quem cruore respersum collo circumdedit suo. Defixerat pavor
cum admiratione Gallos; Romani alacres obviam militi suo progrediuntur
et gratulantes laudantesque ad imperatorem perducunt. Manlius inde
Torquati cognomen accepit.

Idem Manlius, postea consul factus bello Latino, ut disciplinam
militarem restitueret, edixit ne quis extra ordinem in hostes pugnaret.
T. Manlius, consulis filius, cum propius forte ad stationem hostium
accessisset, is, qui Latino equitatui praeerat, ubi consulis filium
agnovit, “Visne” inquit “congredi mecum, ut singularis certaminis eventu
cernatur, quantum eques Latinus Romano praestet?” Movit ferocem animum
iuvenis seu ira seu detrectandi certaminis pudor. Itaque oblitus imperii
paterni in certamen ruit et Latinum ex equo excussum transfixit
spoliisque lectis in castra ad patrem venit. Extemplo filium aversatus
consul milites classico advocat. Qui postquam frequentes convenere,
“Quandoquidem” inquit “tu, fili, contra imperium consulis pugnasti,
oportet disciplinam, quam solvisti, poena tua restituas. Triste
exemplum, sed in posterum salubre iuventuti eris. I, lictor, deliga ad
palum.” Metu omnes obstupuere; sed postquam cervice caesa fusus est
cruor, in questus et lamenta erupere. Manlio Romam redeunti seniores
tantum obviam exierunt: iuventus et tunc eum et omni deinde vita
exsecrata est.

Operae pretium erit aliud severitatis disciplinae Romanae exemplum
proferre, simul ut appareat quam facile severitas in crudelitatem et
furorem abeat. Cn. Piso fuit vir a multis vitiis integer, sed pravus et
cui placebat pro constantia rigor. Is cum iratus ad mortem duci
iussisset militem, quasi interfecisset commilitonem, cum quo egressus
erat e castris et sine quo redierat, roganti tempus aliquod ad
conquirendum non dedit. Damnatus miles extra castrorum vallum ductus est
et iam cervicem porrigebat, cum subito apparuit ille commilito, qui
occisus dicebatur. Tunc centurio supplicio praepositus condere gladium
carnificem iubet. Ambo commilitones alter alterum complexi ingenti
concursu et magno gaudio exercitus deducuntur ad Pisonem. Ille
conscendit tribunal furens et utrumque ad mortem duci iubet, adicit et
centurionem, qui damnatum militem reduxerat, haec praefatus: “Te morte
plecti iubeo, quia iam damnatus es; te, quia causa damnationis
commilitoni fuisti; te, quia iussus occidere militem imperatori non
paruisti.”

Ceterum Manlianae gentis propriam fere fuisse illam in filios
acerbitatem alius Manlius, illius de quo supra diximus nepos, ostendit.
Cum Macedonum legati Romam venissent conquestum de Silano, Manlii
Torquati filio, quod praetor provinciam expilasset, pater, avitae
severitatis heres, petiit a patribus conscriptis ne quid de ea re
statuerent, antequam ipse inspexisset Macedonum et filii sui causam. Id
a senatu libenter concessum est viro summae dignitatis, consulari
iurisque civilis peritissimo. Itaque, instituta domi cognitione causae,
solus per totum biduum utramque partem audiebat ac tertio die
pronuntiavit filium suum videri non talem fuisse in provincia, quales
eius maiores fuissent, et in conspectum suum deinceps venire vetuit. Tam
tristi patris iudicio perculsus lucem ulterius intueri non sustinuit et
proxima nocte vitam suspendio finivit. Peregerat Torquatus severi et
religiosi iudicis partes, satisfactum erat rei publicae, habebat
ultionem Macedonia, at nondum erat inflexus patris rigor. Igitur ne
exsequiis quidem filii interfuit, ut patribus mos erat apud Romanos, et
eo ipso die, quo funus eius ducebatur, aures, ut solebat, volentibus
consulere se de iure praebuit.

    30.8: Cf. p. 3, n. 4.
    30.9: #patrī . . . esse#: ‘that a day had been set against his
    father (for trial),’ i.e. ‘that his father had been summoned to
    appear for trial.’ Among the charges against the elder Manlius was
    that of cruelty to his son. #patrī# is a dat. of disadvantage.
    30.10: #cēpit . . . laudābile#: ‘he formed a plan (which, though
    it gave token) of a rough and uncouth temper (was) nevertheless
    commendable by reason of the filial devotion (which it showed).’
    For #quidem . . . sed#, cf. p. 10, n. 10. #animī# is a genitive of
    quality or description with #cōnsilium#.
    30.11: #ad Pompōnium# = ‘to (the house of) Pomponius.’
    30.12: = a temporal clause: ‘when he had been ushered in.’
    30.13: For the mood, cf. p. 29, n. 16.
    31.1: #quīppe quī#: ‘since indeed he,’ etc. #quī# = _cum is_
    (cf. p. 4, n. 3), and the relative clause has its verb in the
    subjunctive because it expresses a reason: H 592, 1 (517, 3, 1)):
    M 840: A 320, _e_, N. 1: G 633: B 283, 3, _a_.
    31.2: dat. of advantage.
    31.3: #eō# = ‘for this reason,’ explained by #quod . . .
    āvertisset#.
    31.4: #māiōrī fuit honōrī#: ‘was all the more credit’; cf. p. 25,
    n. 6.
    31.5: In the fifth century B.C. the Gauls left their homes in
    northwestern Europe, and, crossing the Alps, gained control of the
    fertile valley of the Po. Hence that part of the Italian peninsula
    was called Gallia Cisalpina. Thence they made raids into the lands
    to the south.
    31.6: With #tertium# sc. _ab urbe Rōmā_. On all the roads leading
    from Rome milestones were set up to mark the distance from the
    gate in the Servian Wall (see map, p. xxviii), by which the road
    issued from the capital.
    31.7: Sc. _duōrum exercituum_, i.e. ‘between the two armies.’
    31.8: #quam . . . potuit#: cf. p. 26, n. 10.
    31.9: subjunctive of exhortation or command: H 559, 1 (484, II):
    M 713: A 266: G 263, 3: B 274.
    31.10: #Iniussū tuō#: ‘without your consent.’
    31.11: subjunctive in an ideal condition: H 576 (509): M 936:
    A 307, _b_: G 596: B 303.
    31.12: In 388 B.C. the Gauls had captured and destroyed all of
    Rome save the Capitol, which was commanded by M. Manlius, the
    father of Titus. He was aroused one night by the cackling of the
    sacred geese, to find that the Gauls had climbed by a secret path,
    and had almost effected an entrance. He awoke the garrison, hurled
    the foremost Gauls back upon their companions, and thus saved the
    Capitol.
    32.1: #macte virtūte . . . estō#: lit., ‘be glorified in
    (respect of) your valor.’ The phrase is in part an expression of
    commendation, like our ‘bravo!’ in part a prayer, like ‘success
    attend thee!’
    32.2: A straight, two-edged sword, not more than two feet long,
    used for thrusting rather than for striking. The Gallic sword was
    long and without point.
    32.3: = _cingit sē_, i.e. ‘girds himself,’ not ‘is girded.’
    32.4: ‘nearer,’ i.e. hand to hand.
    32.5: _cōnsistō_. What tense?
    32.6: #ūnō alterōque īctū#: ‘with one stroke after the other’;
    i.e. he killed him with two quick blows.
    32.7: Sc. _eī_, and render ‘from him as he lay (dead).’ See p. 17,
    n. 4.
    32.8: _respergō_.
    32.9: What case?
    32.10: In its compounds, _dare_ more often = ‘to put’ than ‘to
    give.’
    32.11: #pavor cum admīrātiōne# = _pavor et admīrātiō_; cf. _mentēs
    cum oculīs_, II, 12.
    32.12: #nē quis . . . pūgnāret#: ‘that no one should fight.’ For
    the subjunctive, see p. 9, n. 6.
    32.13: Subject of #accessisset#. For its position, see p. 19,
    n. 7.
    32.14: _āgnōscō_.
    32.15: #dētrēctandī . . . pudor#: ‘his unwillingness to decline
    the fight.’ A literal translation would be impossible. _Pudor_
    implies that he was ashamed to decline lest his refusal should be
    attributed to cowardice.
    33.1: _oblivīscor_.
    33.2: dependent on #oblītus#: H 454 (406, II): M 588: A 219, 1:

    33.3: #excussum trānsfīxit#: cf. p. 2, n. 8.
    33.4: #oportet restituās#: ‘it is fitting that you restore.’
    _Oportet_ is construed either with the infinitive or with the
    subjunctive of result with _ut_ omitted.
    33.5: Why abl.?

    33.9: _ērumpō_.
    33.10: #omnī . . . vītā#: ‘throughout his whole subsequent life.’
    In this sense the simple acc., or the acc. with _per_ is far more
    common. #deinde#, standing between an adj. and a noun, may be
    rendered by an adj.: cf. p. 10, n. 14.
    33.11: #in . . . abeat#: ‘passes over into,’ ‘degenerates into.’
    33.12: #fuit . . . sed#: we would say, ‘was, to be sure, . . .
    but, after all,’ i.e. ‘although he was . . . yet.’ In this sense
    _quidem . . . sed_ is commonly used: cf. p. 10, n. 10.

    34.2: H 426 (385): M 531: A 227: G 346: B 187, II.
    34.3: Join with _propriam_. _Proprius_, like _similis_, is
    construed with both the gen. and the dat.
    34.4: dependent on #ostendit#, l. 81.
    34.5: supine of _conqueror_, expressing purpose. Cf. p. 5, n. 20.
    34.6: ‘when praetor,’ or ‘during his praetorship.’
    34.7: Many, indeed most, governors of provinces enriched
    themselves by extortion.
    34.8: See Vocab., _cōnscrīptus_.
    34.9: #summae . . . perītissimō#: these words contain the reasons
    why #Id . . . concessum est#.
    34.10: _percellō_.
    34.11: #lūcem . . . sustinuit#: ‘he refused to live longer.’ How
    literally?
    34.12: The context must determine whether #proximā nocte# = ‘the
    next night’ or ‘last night.’
    34.13: _pergō_.
    34.14: ‘role.’ This meaning of _partēs_ is borrowed from the
    theater.
    34.15: #nē . . . quidem# is a very strong negative, and generally
    emphasizes some word or phrase placed between the _nē_ and the
    _quidem_.]


#XIV. Publius Decius# [[stripped text]]

P. Decius, Valerio Maximo et Cornelio Cosso consulibus, tribunus militum
fuit. Exercitu Romano in angustiis Gauri montis clauso Decius editum
collem conspexit imminentem hostium castris. Accepto praesidio verticem
occupavit, hostes terruit, consuli spatium dedit ad subducendum agmen in
aequiorem locum. Ipse, colle, quem insederat, undique armatis
circumdato, intempesta nocte per medias hostium custodias somno
oppressas incolumis evasit. Qua re ab exercitu donatus est corona
civica, quae dabatur ei, qui cives in bello servasset. Consul fuit bello
Latino cum Manlio Torquato. Hoc bello cum utrique consuli somnio
obvenisset eos victores futuros, quorum dux in proelio cecidisset,
convenit inter eos uti, utrius cornu in acie laboraret, is diis se
Manibus devoveret. Inclinante sua parte Decius se et hostes diis Manibus
devovit. Armatus in equum insiluit ac se in medios hostes immisit:
corruit obrutus telis et victoriam suis reliquit.

    35.11: Decius’ act was called #dēvōtiō#, and proceeded from the
    idea that for the victim which the Manes seemed to be claiming
    another might be substituted. According to Livy, Decius used this
    formula: “As a substitute for the commonwealth, the army, the
    legions, and the allies of the Roman people I devote to the Manes
    myself and the legions and allies of the enemy.”]


#XV. Manius Curius# [[stripped text]]

Manius Curius contra Samnites profectus eos ingentibus proeliis vicit.
In quo bello cum permultum agri hominumque maximam vim cepisset, ipse
inde ditari adeo noluit, ut, cum interversae pecuniae argueretur,
catillo ligneo, quo uti ad sacrificia consueverat, in medium prolato
iuraret se nihil amplius de praeda hostili in domum suam convertisse.
Curio ad focum sedenti in agresti scamno et ex ligneo catillo cenanti
cum magnum auri pondus Samnites attulissent, repudiati ab eo sunt
dixitque non aurum habere sibi praeclarum videri, sed iis qui haberent
aurum imperare. Quo responso Curius Samnitibus ostendit se neque acie
vinci neque pecunia corrumpi posse. Agri capti septena iugera populo
viritim divisit; cumque ipsi senatus iugera quinquaginta adsignaret,
plus accipere noluit quam singulis civibus erat datum, dixitque
perniciosum esse civem, qui eo, quod reliquis tribueretur, contentus non
esset.

Postea consul creatus adversus Pyrrhum missus est: cumque in Capitolio
delectum haberet et iuniores taedio belli nomina non darent, coniectis
in urnam omnium tribuum nominibus primum nomen urna extractum citari
iussit et cum adulescens non responderet, bona eius hastae subiecit,
deinde cum is questus de iniuria consulis tribunos plebis appellasset,
ipsum quoque vendidit, nihil opus esse rei publicae eo cive, qui
nesciret parere, dicens. Neque tribuni plebis adulescenti auxilio
fuerunt; posteaque res in consuetudinem abiit, ut delectu rite acto, qui
militiam detrectaret, in servitutem venderetur. Hoc terrore ceteri
adacti nomina promptius dederunt.

His copiis Curius Pyrrhi exercitum cecidit deque eo rege triumphavit.
Insignem triumphum fecerunt quattuor elephanti cum turribus suis, tum
primum Romae visi. Victus rex relicto Tarenti praesidio in Epirum
revertit. Cum autem bellum renovaturus putaretur, Manium Curium iterum
consulem fieri placuit. Sed inopinata mors regis Romanos metu liberavit.
Pyrrhus enim, dum Argos oppugnat, urbem iam ingressus a iuvene quodam
Argivo lancea leviter vulneratus est. Mater adulescentis, anus
paupercula, cum aliis mulieribus e tecto domus proelium spectabat; quae
cum vidisset Pyrrhum in auctorem vulneris sui magno impetu ferri,
periculo filii sui commota protinus tegulam corripuit et utraque manu
libratam in caput regis deiecit.

Gaius Duilius Poenos navali pugna primus devicit. Qui cum videret naves
Romanas a Punicis velocitate superari, manus ferreas sive corvos,
machinam ad comprehendendas hostium naves tenendasque utilem,
excogitavit. Quae manus ubi hostilem apprehenderant navem, superiecto
ponte transgrediebatur Romanus et in ipsorum ratibus comminus
dimicabant, unde Romanis, qui robore praestabant, facilis victoria fuit.
Celeriter sunt expugnatae naves Punicae triginta, in quibus etiam
praetoria septiremis capta est, mersae tredecim.

Duilius victor Romam reversus primus navalem triumphum egit. Nulla
victoria Romanis gratior fuit, quod invicti terra iam etiam mari
plurimum possent. Itaque Duilio concessum est, ut per omnem vitam
praelucente funali et praecinente tibicine a cena rediret.

Hannibal, dux classis Punicae, e navi quae iam capiebatur, in scapham
saltu se demittens Romanorum manus effugit. Veritus autem, ne in patria
classis amissae poenas daret, civium odium astutia avertit, nam ex illa
infelici pugna priusquam cladis nuntius domum perveniret quendam ex
amicis Carthaginem misit. Qui postquam curiam intravit, “Consulit”
inquit “vos Hannibal, cum dux Romanorum magnis copiis maritimis
instructis advenerit, num cum eo confligere debeat?” Acclamavit
universus senatus non esse dubium quin confligi oporteret. Tum ille
“Conflixit” inquit “et superatus est.” Ita non potuerunt factum damnare,
quod ipsi fieri debuisse iudicaverant. Sic Hannibal victus crucis

    38.6: Cf. _rēgius_, I, 17. The Romans applied the term _praetor_
    to the commander of any foreign force.
    38.7: Sc. _nāvis_. At this time Carthaginian ships generally had
    five banks of oars. In building the fleet commanded by Duilius,

#XVII. Marcus Atilius Regulus# [[stripped text]]

Marcus Regulus cum Poenos magna clade adfecisset, Hanno Carthaginiensis
ad eum venit, quasi de pace acturus, re vera ut tempus extraheret, donec
novae copiae ex Africa advenirent. Is ubi ad consulem accessit, exortus
est militum clamor auditaque vox, idem huic faciendum esse, quod paucis
ante annis Cornelio consuli a Poenis factum esset. Cornelius enim, velut
in conloquium per fraudem evocatus, a Poenis comprehensus erat et in
vincula coniectus. Iam Hanno timere incipiebat, sed periculum astuto
responso avertit: “Hoc vero” inquit “si feceritis, nihilo eritis Afris
meliores.” Consul tacere iussit eos, qui par pari referri volebant, et
conveniens gravitati Romanae responsum dedit: “Isto te metu, Hanno,
fides Romana liberat.” De pace, quia neque Poenus serio agebat et consul
victoriam quam pacem malebat, non convenit.

Regulus deinde in Africam primus Romanorum ducum traiecit. Clypeam urbem
et trecenta castella expugnavit, neque cum hominibus tantum, sed etiam
cum monstris dimicavit. Nam cum ad flumen Bagradam castra haberet,
anguis mira magnitudine exercitum Romanorum vexabat; multos milites
ingenti ore corripuit; plures caudae verbere elisit; nonnullos ipso
pestilentis halitus adflatu exanimavit. Neque is telorum ictu perforari
poterat, durissima squamarum lorica omnia tela facile repellente.
Confugiendum fuit ad machinas advectisque ballistis et catapultis, velut
arx quaedam munita, deiciendus hostis fuit. Tandem saxorum pondere
oppressus iacuit, sed cruore suo flumen corporisque pestifero adflatu
vicina loca infecit Romanosque castra inde submovere coegit. Corium
beluae, centum et viginti pedes longum, Romam misit Regulus.

Huic ob res bene gestas imperium in annum proximum prorogatum est. Quod
ubi cognovit Regulus, scripsit senatui vilicum suum in agello, quem
septem iugerum habebat, mortuum esse et servum, occasionem nactum,
aufugisse ablato instrumento rustico ideoque petere se ut sibi successor
in Africam mitteretur, ne, deserto agro, non esset unde uxor et liberi
alerentur. Senatus, acceptis litteris, res quas Regulus amiserat publica
pecunia redimi iussit, agellum colendum locavit, alimenta coniugi ac
liberis praebuit. Regulus deinde multis proeliis Carthaginiensium opes
contudit eosque pacem petere coegit. Quam cum Regulus nollet nisi
durissimis condicionibus dare, a Lacedaemoniis illi auxilium petierunt.

Lacedaemonii Xanthippum, virum belli peritissimum, Carthaginiensibus
miserunt, a quo Regulus victus est ultima pernicie: nam duo tantum milia
hominum ex omni Romano exercitu refugerunt et Regulus ipse captus et in
carcerem coniectus est. Inde Romam de permutandis captivis missus est
dato iureiurando. ut, si non impetrasset, rediret ipse Carthaginem. Qui
cum Romam venisset, inductus in senatum mandata exposuit; sententiam ne
diceret recusavit; quamdiu iureiurando hostium teneretur, se non esse
senatorem. Iussus tamen sententiam dicere, negavit esse utile captivos
Poenos reddi, illos enim adulescentes esse et bonos duces, se iam
confectum senectute. Cuius cum valuisset auctoritas, captivi retenti
sunt, ipse, cum retineretur a propinquis et amicis, tamen Carthaginem
rediit: neque vero tunc ignorabat se ad crudelissimum hostem et ad
exquisita supplicia proficisci, sed iusiurandum conservandum putavit.
Reversum Carthaginienses omni cruciatu necaverunt: palpebris enim
resectis aliquamdiu in loco tenebricoso tenuerunt: deinde cum sol esset
ardentissimus, repente eductum intueri caelum coegerunt; postremo in
arcam ligneam, undique clavis praeacutis horrentem et tam angustam, ut
erectus perpetuo manere cogeretur, incluserunt. Ita dum fessum corpus,
quocumque inclinabat, stimulis ferreis confoditur, vigiliis et dolore
continuo interemptus est. Hic fuit Atilii Reguli exitus, ipsa vita
clarior et inlustrior.

  Huīc ob rēs[17] bene gestās imperium in annum proximum prōrogātum

    [Footnotes: XVII (pages 39-42)

    39.7: #clāde adfēcisset# = ‘had inflicted defeat upon.’ Cf. _eō
    genere . . . adficiēbātur_, XVI, 31. The reference is to the naval
    victory off Ecnomus, in Sicily.
    39.8: Note carefully the two ways of expressing purpose, the
    future participle being exactly equivalent to _ut_ with the
    subjunctive. See p. xviii, E 5; #quasi# = ‘as if,’ and is
    contrasted with #rē vērā#, ‘in reality.’
    39.9: The subjunctive in reality expresses purpose. See also p.
    xx, G 3.
    39.10: _exorior_.
    39.11: #idem . . . esse#: ‘the same thing _ought to be done_ to
    him.’ The gerundive with _esse_ denotes either physical necessity
    (‘must’), or moral obligation (‘ought’).
    39.12: abl. of the measure of difference: H 479 (423): M 655:
    A 250: G 403: B 223. #paucīs annīs# is a sort of temporal adverb
    with _ante_.
    40.1: Latin is extremely exact in the use of the tenses. Of two
    _past_ actions the prior is expressed by the _pluperfect_ tense;
    of two _future_ actions the prior is expressed by the _future
    perfect_ tense. Apply this principle here. We say simply, ‘if
    you do.’
    40.2: Join with #meliōrēs#, and cf. p. 39, n. 12.
    40.3: i.e. the Carthaginians. To the Roman mind _Pūnica fidēs_ was
    a synonym for the vilest treachery. So Livy says of the great
    Hannibal that his character was marred by ‘worse than Punic
    treachery.’ For #Āfrīs#, see p. 10, n. 18.
    40.4: #pār . . . referrī# = ‘retaliation.’ How literally?
    40.5: ‘consistent with.’
    40.6: #prīmus . . . trāiēcit#: cf. p. 38, n. 1.
    40.7: indefinite, like our ‘hundreds of.’ _Sēscentī_ and _mīlle_
    are often used in the same way.
    40.8: = _et nōn_ (cf. l. 13).
    40.9: _ēlīdō_.
    40.10: #dūrissimā . . . repellente#: what does the abl. abs.
    express?
    40.11: #Cōnfugiendum . . . ad#: impersonal passive: ‘they had to
    resort to.’ Cf. p. 39, n. 11.
    40.12: The _ballistae_ and _catapultae_ were the artillery of
    antiquity. It is said that from the _ballistae_ stones weighing
    one hundred pounds could be sent half a mile.
    40.13: #velut . . . mūnīta#: to be taken with what follows.
    40.14: _opprimō_.
    40.15: _cōgō_.
    40.16: acc. of extent (cf. p. 12, n. 1) with #longum#.
    40.17: #rēs bene gestās#: ‘successes,’ ‘exploits.’ Contrast _rē
    male gestā_, XVI, 31, and note.
    41.1: Cf. p. 18, n. 17.
    41.2: #occāsiōnem nactum# (_nancīscor_): ‘seizing the
    opportunity.’
    41.3: #īnstrūmentō rūsticō#: ‘his farming implements.’
    41.4: Join with #successor#, and cf. p. 26, n. 5.
    41.5: #unde . . . alerentur#: ‘the wherewithal to support,’ etc.
    41.6: subjunctive partly of purpose, partly by attraction, for
    which see p. 13, n. 10.
    41.7: #colendum#: ‘to be tilled’ (cf. p. 2, n. 18), for Regulus’
    benefit. In such cases the produce of the farm was divided equally
    between owner and tenant.
    41.8: #alimenta . . . praebuit#: i.e. they were supported at
    public expense till the harvest of that year was gathered. No
    salary was given to Roman officials.
    41.9: _contundō_.
    41.10: abl. of manner: H 473, 3 (419, III): M 635: A 248: G 399:
    B 220, 1.
    41.11: #ut . . . redīret# gives the purpose of the Carthaginians
    in exacting the oath.
    41.12: subjunctive in indirect discourse. Regulus said: _Sī nōn
    impetrāverō, . . . redībō._
    41.13: #sententiam . . . recūsāvit#: ‘he refused to express his
    opinion.’ _recūsāre_ is construed (1) with the simple infinitive;
    (2) with _nē_ and a subjunctive of purpose; (3) with _quīn_ or
    _quōminus_ and a subjunctive of result.
    41.14: #quamdiū . . . senātōrem#: indirect discourse = ‘(saying
    that) as long as,’ etc.
    41.15: #negāvit esse ūtile#: ‘he _said_ that it was _not_
    expedient.’ In such sentences _negāre_ rather than _nōn dīcere_ is
    used. The subject of #esse# is the clause #captīvōs . . . reddī#.
    42.1: ‘exhausted.’
    42.2: Here temporal, but in the next line adversative, as is shown
    by #tamen#: see p. xxii, J.
    42.3: Sc. _esse_, and cf. p. 39, n. 11.
    42.4: Sc. _eum_: ‘on his return.’ The story is given by no writer
    earlier than Cicero, and modern historians are inclined to view
    the whole narrative as fictitious.]

Appius Claudius, vir stultae temeritatis, consul adversus Poenos

hostem vidisset, bellum confecturum esse iactitabat. Qui cum, antequam
navale proelium committeret, auspicia haberet pullariusque ei
nuntiasset, pullos non exire e cavea neque vesci, inridens iussit eos in
aquam mergi, ut saltem biberent, quoniam esse nollent. Ea res cum, quasi
iratis diis, milites ad omnia segniores timidioresque fecisset, commisso
proelio magna clades a Romanis accepta est: octo eorum milia caesa sunt,
viginti milia capta. Qua re Claudius postea a populo condemnatus est
damnationisque ignominiam voluntaria morte praevenit. Ea res calamitati
fuit etiam Claudiae, consulis sorori: quae a ludis publicis revertens,
in conferta multitudine aegre procedente carpento, palam optavit ut
frater suus Pulcher revivisceret atque iterum classem amitteret, quo
minor turba Romae foret. Ob vocem illam impiam Claudia quoque damnata

    42.5: #quō diē#: we should expect _diē quō_, or _eōdem diē quō_,
    but the antecedent, as often, is incorporated into the relative
    clause and made to agree with the pronoun: H 399, 3 (445, 9):
    A 200, _b_: G 616: B 251, 4.
    42.6: #auspicia habēret#: cf. _auspicia adhibēre_, I, 42.
    42.7: #pullārius . . . vescī#: on setting out for the seat of war,
    the commanding general often took with him a cage of sacred
    chickens, in charge of a special keeper (#pullārius#). If, when
    food was thrown before them, the chickens ate so greedily that
    portions of the food fell from their mouths to the ground, it was
    considered a very favorable omen. The circumstance described in
    the text would be regarded by the superstitious soldiery as of
    very dire significance.
    43.1: infinitive of _edō_.
    43.2: #quasi . . . diīs#: ‘because (as they supposed), the gods
    were angry.’ Cf. p. 3, n. 6. #īrātīs diīs# is an abl. abs.
    43.3: The battle was fought off Drepanum, in Sicily. Appius lost
    93 out of 123 ships.

#XIX. Quintus Fabius Maximus# [[stripped text]]

Hannibal, Hamilcaris filius, novem annos natus, a patre aris admotus
odium in Romanos perenne iuravit. Quae res maxime videtur concitasse
secundum Punicum bellum. Nam, mortuo Hamilcare, Hannibal causam belli
quaerens Saguntum, civitatem Hispaniae Romanis foederatam evertit.
Quapropter Roma missi sunt Carthaginem legati, qui Hannibalem, mali
auctorem, exposcerent. Tergiversantibus Poenis Quintus Fabius,
legationis princeps, sinu ex toga facto “Hic” inquit “vobis bellum et
pacem portamus; utrum placet, sumite.” Poenis daret utrum vellet
succlamantibus, Fabius, excussa toga, bellum se dare dicit. Poeni
accipere se responderunt et, quibus acciperent animis, iisdem se
gesturos.

Hannibal superatis Pyrenaei et Alpium iugis in Italiam venit. Publium
Scipionem apud Ticinum amnem, Sempronium apud Trebiam, Flaminium apud
Trasumenum profligavit.

Adversus hostem totiens victorem missus Quintus Fabius dictator
Hannibalis impetum mora fregit; namque, priorum ducum cladibus edoctus
belli rationem mutare et adversus Hannibalem, successibus proeliorum
insolentem, recedere ab ancipiti discrimine et tueri tantummodo Italiam
constituit Cunctatorisque nomen et laudem summi ducis meruit. Per loca
alta agmen ducebat modico ab hoste intervallo, ut neque omitteret eum
neque cum eo congrederetur; castris, nisi quantum necessitas cogeret,
miles tenebatur. Dux neque occasioni rei bene gerendae deerat, si qua ab
hoste daretur, neque ullam ipse hosti dabat. Itaque cum ex levibus
proeliis superior discederet, militem minus iam coepit aut virtutis suae
aut fortunae paenitere.

His artibus cum Hannibalem Fabius in agro Falerno locorum angustiis
clausisset, ille sine ullo exercitus detrimento se expedivit. Namque
arida sarmenta in boum cornibus deligata principio noctis incendi
bovesque ad montes, quos Romani insederant, agi iussit. Qui cum accensis
cornibus per montes, per silvas huc illuc discurrerent, Romani miraculo
attoniti constiterunt; ipse Fabius, insidias esse ratus, militem extra
vallum egredi vetuit. Interea Hannibal ex angustiis evasit.

Dein Hannibal, ut Fabio apud suos conflaret invidiam, agrum eius,
omnibus circa vastatis, intactum reliquit. At Fabius, misso Romam Quinto
filio, inviolatum ab hoste agrum vendidit eiusque pretio captivos
Romanos redemit.

Haud grata tamen Romanis erat Fabii cunctatio: eumque pro cauto timidum,
pro cunctatore segnem vocitabant. Augebat invidiam Minucius, magister
equitum, dictatorem criminando: illum in ducendo bello sedulo tempus
terere, quo diutius in magistratu esset solusque et Romae et in exercitu
imperium haberet. His sermonibus accensa plebs dictatori magistrum
equitum imperio aequavit. Hanc iniuriam aequo animo tulit Fabius
exercitumque suum cum Minucio divisit. Cum autem Minucius temere
proelium commisisset, ei periclitanti auxilio venit Fabius. Cuius subito
adventu repressus Hannibal receptui cecinit, palam confessus ab se
Minucium, se a Fabio victum esse. Redeuntem ex acie dixisse eum ferunt
tandem eam nubem, quae sedere in iugis montium solita esset, cum
procella imbrem dedisse. Minucius autem periculo liberatus castra cum
Fabio iunxit et patrem eum appellavit idemque facere milites iussit.

Postea Hannibal Tarento per proditionem potitus est. Hanc urbem ut
Poenis traderent, tredecim fere nobiles iuvenes Tarentini coniuraverant.
Hi, nocte per speciem venandi urbe egressi, ad Hannibalem, qui haud
procul castra habebat, venerunt. Cui cum quid pararent exposuissent,
conlaudavit eos Hannibal monuitque ut redeuntes pecora Carthaginiensium,
quae pastum propulsa essent, ad urbem agerent et veluti praedam ex hoste
factam aut praefecto aut custodibus portarum donarent. Id iterum ac
saepius ab iis factum eoque consuetudinis adducta res est, ut, quocumque
noctis tempore sibilo dedissent signum, porta urbis aperiretur. Tunc
Hannibal eos nocte media cum decem milibus hominum delectorum secutus
est. Ubi portae appropinquarunt, nota iuvenum vox et familiare signum
vigilem excitavit. Duo primi inferebant aprum vasti corporis. Vigil
incautus, dum beluae magnitudinem miratur, venabulo occisus est.
Ingressi proditores ceteros vigiles sopitos obtruncant. Tum Hannibal cum
suo agmine ingreditur: Romani passim trucidantur. Livius Salinator,
Romanorum praefectus, cum iis, qui caedi superfuerunt, in arcem
confugit.

Profectus igitur Fabius ad recipiendum Tarentum urbem obsidione cinxit.
Leve dictu momentum ad rem ingentem perficiendam eum adiuvit. Praefectus
praesidii Tarentini deperibat amore mulierculae, cuius frater in
exercitu Fabii erat. Miles iussus a Fabio pro perfuga Tarentum transiit
ac per sororem praefectum ad tradendam urbem perpulit. Fabius vigilia
prima accessit ad eam partem muri, quam praefectus custodiebat.
Adiuvantibus recipientibusque eius militibus, Romani in urbem
transcenderunt. Inde, proxima porta refracta, Fabius cum exercitu
intravit. Hannibal nuntiata Tarenti oppugnatione, cum ad opem ferendam
festinans captam urbem esse audivisset, “Et Romani” inquit “suum
Hannibalem habent: eadem, qua ceperamus, arte Tarentum amisimus.”

Cum postea Livius Salinator coram Fabio gloriaretur, quod arcem
Tarentinam retinuisset, dixissetque eum sua opera Tarentum recepisse,
“Certe” inquit Fabius ridens, “nam nisi tu amisisses, ego numquam
recepissem.”

Quintus Fabius iam senex filio suo consuli legatus fuit; cumque in eius
castra veniret, filius obviam patri progressus est, duodecim lictoribus
pro more antecedentibus. Equo vehebatur senex neque appropinquante
consule descendit. Iam ex lictoribus undecim verecundia paternae
maiestatis taciti praeterierant. Quod cum consul animadvertisset,
proximum lictorem iussit inclamare Fabio patri ut ex equo descenderet.
Pater tum desiliens “Non ego, fili,” inquit “tuum imperium contempsi,
sed experiri volui num scires consulem te esse.” Ad summam senectutem
vixit Fabius Maximus, dignus tanto cognomine. Cautior quam promptior
habitus est, sed insita eius ingenio prudentia ei bello, quod tum
gerebatur, proprie apta erat. Nemini dubium est quin rem Romanam
cunctando restituerit. Ut Scipio pugnando, ita hic non dimicando maxime
civitati Romanae succurrisse visus est. Alter enim celeritate sua
Carthaginem oppressit, alter cunctatione id egit, ne Roma opprimi
posset.

    43.10: In the latter part of the First Punic War Hamilcar had
    successfully maintained himself for several years in Sicily
    against the Romans. Subsequently he built up a great Carthaginian
    empire in Spain, partly to offset the losses which Carthage had
    sustained in its struggle with Rome, and partly to supply it with
    the means for a renewal of the conflict.
    43.11: #novem . . . nātus#: ‘when only nine years old.’
    43.12: Cf. p. 10, n. 15.
    43.13: This war lasted from 218 to 202 B.C.
    44.1: When Hamilcar was killed in battle in Spain in 227, his
    son-in-law Hasdrubal took command of the Carthaginian forces
    there. He in turn was succeeded by Hannibal in 219.
    44.2: dat. with #foederātam#. Cf. H 428, 3 (385, 4, 3): A 248,
    _a_, R.: G 359: B 192, 1. Compare the dat. used with _iungō_ and
    _mīsceō_.
    44.3: #utrum# is here a relative pronoun; hence the indicative
    #placet#, with which we must supply _vōbīs_. In #utrum vellet#,
    however, #utrum# is interrogative: hence the subjunctive.
    44.4: = a subjunctive in ind. disc. representing an original
    imperative. See p. xxvi, M 6.
    44.5: _excutiō_.
    44.6: #quibus . . . animīs, iīsdem#: abl. of manner. See p. 42,
    n. 5.
    44.7: Sc. _bellum_.
    44.8: P. Cornelius Scipio, father of the famous P. Cornelius
    Scipio Africanus Maior, and consul in 218.
    44.9: The first two battles were fought in 218, the third in 217.
    44.10: See Vocab., _dictātor_.
    44.11: Cf. p. 28, n. 17.
    44.12: #adversus Hannibalem# = a causal clause: ‘since he was
    facing H.’ Here again the Latin feels the lack of a participle to
    _sum_.
    44.13: #recēdere . . . discrīmine#: ‘to avoid (any) hazardous
    risk.’ #recēdere# depends on #cōnstituit#, l. 22.
    44.14: #modicō . . . intervāllō#: we say, ‘at a moderate
    distance.’ For the abl., see p. 39, n. 12.
    44.15: ‘let slip,’ ‘lose sight of.’
    45.1: apparently = _in castrīs_, but really an abl. of means.
    45.2: #nisi . . . cōgeret#: ‘except as far as necessity forced
    (Fabius to lead them forth).’ #cōgeret# is an example of the
    iterative subjunctive, used to denote the frequent repetition of
    an act. It generally occurs in clauses containing a past tense,
    and is common in Livy, on whom this story is based.
    45.3: #neque . . . deerat#: ‘missed no chance of scoring a
    success.’
    45.4: #reī bene gerendae#: cf. p. 40, n. 17.
    45.5: #mīlitem . . . paenitēre#: ‘the soldiers began to be less
    discontented with (i.e. to be more confident of),’ etc. For the
    construction, see p. 28, n. 7.
    45.6: #dēligāta . . . incendī# = _dēligārī et incendī_.
    45.7: Why abl.?
    45.8: _reor_.
    45.9: Render by a noun: ‘sluggard.’
    45.10: See Vocab., _magister_.
    45.11: indirect discourse, dependent on the verb of saying
    suggested by #crīminandō#.
    45.12: Indirect object with #aequāvit#, which = _aequum fēcit_.
    46.1: #abl.# of specification.
    46.2: #aequō animō# is an abl. of manner (p. 41, n. 10), and =
    ‘patiently.’
    46.3: #eī . . . auxiliō#: ‘to help him in his peril.’ Cf. p. 25,
    n. 6.
    46.4: #receptuī cecinit#: ‘gave the signal for a retreat.’
    #receptuī# is a dat. of purpose: cf. p. 25, n. 6. _canere_ is used
    of instrumental music (here of playing on the trumpet) as well as
    of vocal.
    46.5: _cōnfiteor_.
    46.6: i.e. Hannibal.
    46.7: #tandem . . . dedisse#: ‘the cloud . . . had at last brought
    wind and rain,’ i.e. Fabius, after so long threatening the
    Carthaginians, had at last proceeded to active measures.
    46.8: Cf. p. 4, n. 6.
    46.9: #per . . . vēnandī#: ‘under pretense of hunting.’
    46.10: a substantive clause of purpose, object of #monuit#.
    46.11: supine of _pāscō_, denoting the purpose of #prōpulsa
    essent#: cf. p. 5, n. 20.
    46.12: _veluti . . . factam_: ‘as if they (i.e. the cattle) were
    plunder captured from the foe.’ #praedam# is accus. by attraction
    to _ea pecora_, to be supplied as the object of dōnārent.
    46.13: #eō . . . est#: lit., ‘to such a degree of custom was the
    matter brought,’ = ‘so customary did this proceeding become.’
    #cōnsuētūdinis# is a partitive gen. with #eō#, which strictly =
    ‘thither, to that point.’
    46.14: subjunctive by attraction (p. 13, n. 10) to #aperīrētur#,
    which itself denotes result.
    47.1: ‘who were buried in slumber.’ The perf. pass. part. here, as
    often, = a relative clause.
    47.2: #Leve . . . mōmentum#: ‘a circumstance (almost too) trifling
    to mention.’ For #dictū#, see p. 19, n. 15.
    47.3: #dēperībat amōre#: ‘was dying for (lit. because of) love,’
    i.e. was desperately in love with.
    47.4: objective gen. with #amōre#: cf. p. 14, n. 15.
    47.5: #ad . . . perpulit# (_perpellō_): ‘drove him to,’ i.e.
    induced him to, etc.
    47.6: ‘#watch.#’
    47.7: _refringō_.
    47.8: emphatic by reason of its position before the conjunction
    #cum#: cf. p. 19, n. 8.
    47.9: #suum Hannibalem#: ‘a Hannibal of their own.’
    47.10: Cf. p. 14, n. 1.
    47.11: i.e. Fabius. Livius said: _meā operā tū Tarentum
    recēpistī_.
    47.12: A conditional sentence, containing a supposition contrary
    to the facts: H 579 and N. (510 and N. 1): M 938: A 308: G 597:
    B 304.
    48.1: #equō vehēbātur#: ‘was riding.’ #equō# is an abl. of means.
    48.2: #verēcundiā . . . māiestātis#: ‘out of respect for his
    dignity as a father.’ Explain the case of #verēcundiā#, also of
    #māiestātis#. Roman fathers were as absolutely masters of their
    children as they were of their slaves. Yet the rights of a son in
    official position took precedence of the honors due a father.
    48.3: Cf. p. 12, n. 3.
    48.4: abl. with #dīgnus#: H 481 (421, III): M 654: A 245, _a_:
    G 397, N. 2: B 226, 2.
    48.5: #Cautior . . . est#: = ‘he was accounted cautious rather
    than alert.’ See H 499 (444, 2): M 429: A 192: G 299: B 240, 4.
    48.6: #īnsita . . . prūdentia#: ‘his innate caution’; lit., the
    caution implanted in his nature. For _ingeniō_, see p. 2, n. 7.
    48.7: possessive dative: ‘no one has a doubt.’
    48.8: Cf. p. 39, n. 4.

    48.10: abl. of means. With #cunctandō# cf. _morā_, l. 19, and
    _cunctātiōne_, l. 109.
    48.11: #id . . . posset#: ‘accomplished this, that it should be

magis placebat; Varro autem, ferox et temerarius, acriora sequebatur
consilia. Ambo consules ad vicum, qui Cannae appellabatur, castra
communiverunt. Ibi deinde Varro, invito conlega, aciem instruxit et
signum pugnae dedit. Hannibal autem ita constituerat aciem, ut Romanis
et solis radii et ventus ab oriente pulverem adflans adversi essent.
Victus caesusque est Romanus exercitus; nusquam graviore vulnere
adflicta est res publica. Aemilius Paulus telis obrutus cecidit: quem
cum media in pugna sedentem in saxo oppletum cruore conspexisset quidam
tribunus militum, “Cape” inquit “hunc equum et fuge, Aemili. Etiam sine
tua morte lacrimarum satis luctusque est.” Ad ea consul: “Tu quidem
macte virtute esto! Sed cave exiguum tempus e manibus hostium evadendi
perdas! Abi, nuntia patribus ut urbem muniant ac prius quam hostis
victor adveniat, praesidiis firment. Me in hac strage meorum militum
patere exspirare.” Alter consul cum paucis equitibus Venusiam perfugit.
Consulares aut praetorii occiderunt viginti, senatores capti aut occisi
triginta, nobiles viri trecenti, militum quadraginta milia, equitum tria
milia et quingenti. Hannibal in testimonium victoriae suae tres modios
aureorum anulorum Carthaginem misit, quos de manibus equitum Romanorum
et senatorum detraxerat.

Hannibali victori cum ceteri gratularentur suaderentque ut quietem iam
ipse sumeret et fessis militibus daret, unus ex eius praefectis,
Maharbal, minime cessandum ratus, Hannibalem hortabatur ut statim Romam
pergeret, die quinto victor in Capitolio epulaturus. Cumque Hannibal
illud non probasset, Maharbal “Non omnia nimirum” inquit “eidem dii
dedere. Vincere scis, Hannibal; victoria uti nescis.” Mora huius diei
satis creditur saluti fuisse urbi et imperio. Hannibal cum victoria
posset uti, frui maluit, relictaque Roma in Campaniam divertit, cuius
deliciis mox exercitus ardor elanguit, adeo ut vere dictum sit Capuam
Hannibali Cannas fuisse.

Numquam tantum pavoris Romae fuit, quantum ubi acceptae cladis nuntius
advenit. Neque tamen ulla pacis mentio facta est; quin etiam animo
civitas adeo magno fuit, ut Varroni ex tanta clade redeunti obviam irent
et gratias agerent, quod de re publica non desperasset: qui, si Poenorum
dux fuisset, temeritatis poenas omni supplicio dedisset. Non autem vitae
cupiditate, sed rei publicae amore se superfuisse reliquo aetatis suae
tempore approbavit. Nam et barbam capillumque submisit, et postea
numquam recubans cibum cepit; honoribus quoque, cum ei deferrentur a
populo, renuntiavit, dicens felicioribus magistratibus rei publicae opus
esse. Dum igitur Hannibal segniter et otiose agebat. Romani interim
respirare coeperunt. Arma non erant: detracta sunt templis vetera
hostium spolia. Deerat iuventus: servi manumissi et armati sunt. Egebat
aerarium: opes suas libens senatus in medium protulit, nec praeter quod
in bullis singulisque anulis erat quidquam sibi auri reliquerunt. Patrum
exemplum secuti sunt equites imitataeque equites omnes tribus. Denique
vix suffecere tabulae, vix scribarum manus, cum omnes privatae opes in
publicum deferrentur.

Cum Hannibal redimendi sui copiam captivis Romanis fecisset, decem ex
ipsis Romam ea de re missi sunt; nec pignus aliud fidei ab iis
postulatum est, quam ut iurarent se, si non impetrassent, in castra esse
redituros. Eos senatus non redimendos censuit responditque eos cives non
esse necessarios, qui, cum armati essent, capi potuissent. Ūnus ex iis
legatis e castris Poenorum egressus, veluti aliquid oblitus, paulo post
in castra erat regressus, deinde comites ante noctem adsecutus erat. Is
ergo, re non impetrata, domum abiit; reditu enim in castra se liberatum
esse iureiurando interpretabatur. Quod ubi innotuit, iussit senatus
illum comprehendi et vinctum duci ad Hannibalem. Ea res Hannibalis
audaciam maxime fregit, quod senatus populusque Romanus rebus adflictis
tam excelso esset animo.

    48.12: Since the battle at Lake Trasumenus (XIX, 17), there had
    been no general engagement between the Romans and Hannibal. The
    latter, closely watched and followed by Fabius, had marched into
    southern Italy, hoping to induce the peoples there to desert Rome
    and join him. When Fabius resigned the dictatorship at the end of
    the legal period, C. Terentius Varro and L. Aemilius Paulus were
    elected consuls. Their army numbered 80,000 men, and their
    instructions were to fight as speedily as possible.
    49.1: A further cause of trouble between the consuls was the fact
    that Paulus was a patrician, Varro a plebeian.
    49.2: #invītō conlēgā#: abl. abs.: ‘though opposed by his
    colleague.’ How literally? The consuls held supreme command on
    alternate days.
    49.3: Construe with #adversī#.
    49.4: H 83, 5 (51, 5): M 152: A 40, _c_: G 33, 2: B 25, 1.
    49.5: sc. _inquit_.
    49.6: #Tū . . . estō#: ‘God bless you!’ Cf. p. 32, n. 1.
    49.7: #cavē . . . perdās# = _cavē nē . . . perdās_: ‘Take care
    lest,’ etc. For this form see H 561, 2 (489, 2): M 715: A 269,
    _a_, 3: G 271, 2: B 276, _c_. We really have two commands here
    side by side, thus: ‘Take care’; ‘Don’t waste,’ etc.
    49.8: imperative of _patior_.
    49.9: #in . . . suae#: ‘to prove his victory.’
    49.10: The custom of wearing rings was universal among the Romans,
    having arisen out of their use as signets. Originally they were of
    iron. When gold rings were first used they served to distinguish
    the higher classes.
    50.1: #minimē . . . ratus#: ‘thinking that there ought to be no
    delay.’ With #cessandum# sc. _esse_, and see p. 16, n. 8.
    50.2: #victor . . . epulātūrus#: ‘for he would surely dine as
    victor on the Capitol.’ The fut. part. is often thus used to
    denote the certain occurrence of a future event. Further, the
    clause expresses the reason why Maharbal urged H. to proceed to
    Rome. What were Maharbal’s exact words?
    50.3: dat. sing.
    50.4: Cf. p. 25, n. 6. Contrast the words of a modern historian:
    “Hannibal knew Rome better than the simpletons who, in ancient and
    modern times, have fancied that he might have terminated the
    struggle by a march on the enemy’s capital.”
    50.5: #cūius . . . fuisse#: a gross exaggeration. Hannibal
    successfully maintained himself in Italy till recalled in 203.
    50.6: Capua, at this time the most powerful city in Italy next to
    Rome, had formed an alliance with Hannibal after the battle of
    Cannae.
    50.7: Sc. _fuit._
    50.8: #quīn etiam#: ‘on the contrary.’
    50.9: For the construction, see p. 47, n. 12. For the fact, cf.
    XVI, 19 ff.
    50.10: #superfuisse . . . approbāvit#: ‘he showed that he had
    effected his escape (lit., had survived).’
    50.11: ‘let grow.’ This manner of showing grief is often
    mentioned.
    50.12: The Romans reclined on the left side at meals. Varro’s act
    was a kind of penance, since it indicated that he denied himself
    the pleasures of the table.
    51.1: #magistrātibus . . . esse#: cf. p. 37, notes 3 and 4.
    51.2: ‘to repair their losses’; lit., ‘to get their breath again.’
    51.3: dat.; cf. p. 2, n. 7. After a victory, captured arms, as
    well as a portion of the captured treasure, were hung up in some
    temple as a thank-offering to the gods.
    51.4: #singulīs . . . ānulīs#: ‘a ring apiece.’
    51.5: #vix . . . manūs#: i.e. they hardly had clerks and tablets
    sufficient to keep the record of contributions.
    51.6: #redimendī suī#: ‘of ransoming themselves.’ H 626, 3 (542,
    #I#, N. 1): M 1000: A 298, _a_: G 428, R. 1: B 339, 5.
    51.7: #velutī . . . oblītus#: ‘pretending to have forgotten
    something.’ How literally?
    51.8: A neuter pronoun or adjective is often used with verbs of
    remembering or forgetting. Contrast _oblīta frātrum_, IV, 37, and
    note.
    51.9: ‘maintained, held.’
    52.1: abl. abs.: ‘though their affairs were at the lowest ebb.’]


#XXI. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus# [[stripped text]]

Publius Cornelius Scipio nondum annos pueritiae egressus patrem
singulari virtute servavit; qui cum pugna apud Ticinum contra Hannibalem
commissa graviter vulneratus in hostium manus iam iam venturus esset,
filius interiecto corpore Poenis inruentibus se opposuit et patrem
periculo liberavit. Quae pietas Scipioni postea aedilitatem petenti
favorem populi conciliavit. Cum obsisterent tribuni plebis, negantes
rationem eius esse habendam, quod nondum ad petendum legitima aetas
esset, “Si me” inquit Scipio “omnes Quirites aedilem facere volunt,
satis annorum habeo.” Tanto inde favore ad suffragia itum est, ut
tribuni incepto desisterent.

Post cladem Cannensem Romani exercitus reliquiae Canusium perfugerant;
cumque ibi tribuni militum quattuor essent, tamen omnium consensu ad
Publium Scipionem, admodum adulescentem, summa imperii delata est.
Quibus consultantibus nuntiat Publius Furius Philus, consularis viri
filius, nobiles quosdam iuvenes propter desperationem consilium de
Italia deserenda inire. Statim in hospitium Metelli, qui conspirationis
erat princeps, se contulit Scipio, et cum concilium ibi iuvenum, de
quibus adlatum erat, invenisset, stricto super capita consultantium
gladio, “Iurate” inquit “vos neque ipsos rem publicam populi Romani
deserturos, neque alium civem Romanum deserere passuros: qui non
iuraverit, in se hunc gladium strictum esse sciat.” Haud secus pavidi,
quam si victorem Hannibalem cernerent, iurant omnes custodiendosque
semet ipsos Scipioni tradunt.

Cum Romani duas clades in Hispania accepissent duoque ibi summi
imperatores intra dies triginta cecidissent, placuit exercitum augeri
eoque proconsulem mitti; nec tamen quem mitterent satis constabat. Ea de
re indicta sunt comitia. Primo populus exspectabat ut, qui se tanto
dignos imperio crederent, nomina profiterentur; sed nemo audebat illud
imperium suscipere. Maesta igitur civitas ac prope inops consilii
comitiorum die in campum descendit. Subito P. Cornelius Scipio, quattuor
et viginti ferme annos natus, professus se petere, in superiore, unde
conspici posset, loco constitit. In quem postquam omnium ora conversa
sunt, ad unum omnes Scipionem in Hispania proconsulem esse iusserunt. At
postquam animorum impetus resedit, populum Romanum coepit facti
paenitere: aetati Scipionis maxime diffidebant. Quod ubi animadvertit
Scipio, advocata contione ita magno elatoque animo de bello, quod
gerendum esset, disseruit, ut homines cura liberaret speque certissima
impleret.

Profectus igitur in Hispaniam Scipio Carthaginem Novam, quo die venit,
expugnavit. Eo congestae erant omnes paene Africae et Hispaniae opes,
ibi arma, ibi pecunia, ibi totius Hispaniae obsides erant: quibus
omnibus potitus est Scipio. Inter captivos ad eum adducta est eximiae
formae adulta virgo. Quam ubi comperit inlustri loco inter Celtiberos
natam principique eius gentis adulescenti desponsam esse, arcessitis
parentibus et sponso eam reddidit. Parentes virginis, qui ad eam
redimendam satis magnum auri pondus attulerant, Scipionem orabant ut id
a se donum acciperet. Scipio aurum ante pedes poni iussit vocatoque ad
se virginis sponso, “Super dotem” inquit “quam accepturus a socero es,
haec tibi a me dotalia dona accedent” aurumque tollere ac sibi habere
iussit. Ille domum reversus ad referendam Scipioni gratiam Celtiberos
Romanis conciliavit.

Deinde Scipio Hasdrubalem victum ex Hispania expulit. Castris hostium
potitus omnem praedam militibus concessit, captivos Hispanos sine pretio
domum dimisit; Afros vero vendi iussit. Erat inter eos puer adultus
regii generis, forma insigni: quem cum percontaretur Scipio quis et
cuias esset, et cur id aetatis in castris fuisset, “Numida sum” inquit
puer, “Massivam populares vocant: orbus a patre relictus, apud avum
maternum, Numidiae regem, educatus sum. Cum avunculo Masinissa, qui
nuper subsidio Carthaginiensibus venit, in Hispaniam traieci; prohibitus
propter aetatem a Masinissa numquam ante proelium inii. Eo die, quo
pugnatum est cum Romanis, inscio avunculo, clam armis equoque sumpto, in
aciem exii: ibi, prolapso equo, captus sum a Romanis.” Scipio eum
interrogat velletne ad avunculum reverti. Cum, effusis gaudio lacrimis,
id vero se cupere puer diceret, tum Scipio puero anulum aureum equumque
ornatum donat datisque qui tuto deducerent equitibus dimisit.

Cum Publius Cornelius Scipio se erga Hispanos clementer gessisset,
circumfusa multitudo eum regem ingenti consensu appellavit; at Scipio,
silentio per praeconem facto, “Nomen imperatoris” inquit, “quo me mei
milites appellarunt, mihi maximum est: regium nomen, alibi magnum, Romae
intolerabile est. Si id amplissimum iudicatis, quod regale est, vobis
licet existimare regalem in me esse animum; sed oro vos ut a regis
appellatione abstineatis.” Sensere etiam barbari magnitudinem animi, qua
Scipio id aspernabatur, quod ceteri mortales admirantur et concupiscunt.

Scipio recepta Hispania cum iam bellum in ipsam Africam transferre
meditaretur, conciliandos prius regum et gentium animos existimavit.
Syphacem, Maurorum regem, opulentissimum totius Africae regem, quem
magno usui sibi fore speraret, primum tentare statuit. Itaque legatum
cum donis ad eum misit C. Laelium, quocum intima familiaritate vivebat.
Syphax amicitiam Romanorum se accipere adnuit, sed fidem nec dare nec
accipere, nisi cum ipso coram duce Romano, voluit. Scipio igitur in
Africam traiecit. Forte ita incidit, ut eo ipso tempore Hasdrubal pulsus
Hispania ad eundem portum appelleret, Syphacis amicitiam pariter
petiturus. Uterque a rege in hospitium invitatus. Cenatum simul apud
regem est; eodem etiam lecto Scipio atque Hasdrubal accubuerunt. Tanta
autem inerat comitas in Scipione, ut non Syphacem modo, sed etiam hostem
infestissimum Hasdrubalem sibi conciliaret. Scipio, foedere icto cum
Syphace, in Hispaniam ad exercitum rediit.

Masinissa quoque amicitiam cum Scipione iungere iam dudum cupiebat.
Quare ad eum tres Numidarum principes misit ad tempus locumque conloquio
statuendum. Duos pro obsidibus retineri a Scipione iubet; remisso
tertio, qui Masinissam ad locum constitutum adduceret, Scipio et
Masinissa cum paucis in conloquium venerunt. Ceperat iam ante Numidam ex
fama rerum gestarum admiratio viri, sed maior praesentis veneratio
cepit: erat enim in vultu maiestas summa; accedebat promissa caesaries
habitusque corporis, non cultus munditiis, sed virilis vere ac
militaris, et florens iuventa. Prope attonitus ipso congressu Numida
gratias de filio fratris remisso agit: adfirmat se ex eo tempore eam
quaesivisse occasionem, quam tandem oblatam non omiserit; cupere se illi
et populo Romano operam navare. Laetus eum Scipio audivit atque in
societatem recepit.

Scipio deinde Romam rediit et ante annos consul factus est. Sicilia ei
provincia decreta est permissumque ut in Africam inde traiceret. Qui cum
vellet ex fortissimis peditibus Romanis trecentorum equitum numerum
complere, nec posset illos subito armis et equis instruere, id prudenti
consilio perfecit. Namque ex omni Sicilia trecentos iuvenes nobilissimos
et ditissimos, qui equis militarent et secum in Africam traicerent,
legit diemque iis edixit, qua equis armisque instructi atque ornati
adessent. Gravis ea militia, procul domo, terra marique multos labores,
magna pericula adlatura videbatur; neque ipsos modo, sed parentes
cognatosque eorum ea cura angebat. Ubi dies quae dicta erat advenit,
arma equosque ostenderunt, sed omnes fere longinquum et grave bellum
horrere apparebat. Tunc Scipio militiam iis se remissurum ait, si arma
et equos militibus Romanis voluissent tradere. Laeti condicionem
acceperunt iuvenes Siculi. Ita Scipio sine publica impensa suos
instruxit ornavitque equites.

Tunc Scipio ex Sicilia in Africam vento secundo profectus est tanto
militum ardore, ut non ad bellum duci viderentur, sed ad certa victoriae
praemia. Celeriter naves e conspectu Siciliae ablatae sunt conspectaque
brevi Africae litora. Scipio cum egrediens ad terram navi prolapsus
esset et ob hoc attonitos milites cerneret, id, quod trepidationem
adferebat, in hortationem convertens, “Africam oppressi” inquit,
“milites!” Expositis copiis in proximis tumulis castra metatus est. Ibi
speculatores hostium in castris deprehensos et ad se perductos nec
supplicio adfecit nec de consiliis ac viribus Poenorum percontatus est,
sed circa omnes Romani exercitus manipulos curavit deducendos; dein
interrogatos num ea satis considerassent, quae speculari erant iussi,
prandio dato incolumes dimisit.

Scipioni in Africam advenienti Masinissa se coniunxit cum parva equitum
turma. Syphax vero a Romanis ad Poenos defecerat. Hasdrubal, Poenorum
dux, Syphaxque Scipioni se opposuerunt, qui utriusque castra una nocte
perrupit et incendit. Syphax ipse captus et vivus ad Scipionem
pertractus est. Syphacem in castra adduci cum esset nuntiatum, omnis
velut ad spectaculum triumphi multitudo effusa est; praecedebat ipse
vinctus, sequebatur grex nobilium Maurorum. Movebat omnes fortuna viri,
cuius amicitiam olim Scipio petierat. Regem aliosque captivos Romam
misit Scipio; Masinissam, qui egregie rem Romanam adiuverat, aurea
corona donavit.

Haec et aliae, quae sequebantur, clades Carthaginiensibus tantum
terroris intulerunt, ut Hannibalem ex Italia ad tuendam patriam
revocarent. Frendens gemensque ac vix lacrimis temperans is dicitur
legatorum verba audisse mandatisque paruisse. Respexit saepe Italiae
litora, semet accusans, quod non victorem exercitum statim ab Cannensi
pugna Romam duxisset. Zamam venerat Hannibal, quae urbs quinque dierum
iter a Carthagine abest, et nuntium ad Scipionem misit ut conloquendi
secum potestatem faceret. Scipio cum conloquium haud abnuisset, dies
locusque constituitur. Itaque congressi sunt duo clarissimi suae aetatis
duces. Steterunt aliquamdiu taciti mutuaque admiratione defixi. Cum vero
de condicionibus pacis inter eos non convenisset, ad suos se receperunt,
renuntiantes armis decernendum esse. Commisso deinde proelio Hannibal
victus cum quattuor equitibus fugit. Ceterum constat utrumque de altero
confessum esse nec melius instrui aciem nec acrius potuisse pugnari.

Carthaginienses metu perculsi ad petendam pacem oratores mittunt
triginta civitatis principes. Qui ubi in castra Romana venerunt, veniam
civitati petebant non culpam purgantes, sed initium culpae in Hannibalem
transferentes. Victis leges imposuit Scipio. Legati, cum nullas
condiciones recusarent, Romam profecti sunt, ut, quae a Scipione pacta
essent, ea patrum ac populi auctoritate confirmarentur. Ita pace terra
marique parta, Scipio exercitu in naves imposito Romam revertit. Ad quem
advenientem concursus ingens factus est; effusa non ex urbibus modo, sed
etiam ex agris multitudo viam obsidebat. Scipio inter gratulantium
plausus triumpho omnium clarissimo urbem est invectus primusque nomine
victae a se gentis est nobilitatus Africanusque appellatus.

Ex his rebus gestis virum eum esse virtutis divinae vulgo creditum est.
Id etiam dicere haud piget, quod scriptores de eo litteris mandaverunt,
Scipionem consuevisse, priusquam dilucesceret, in Capitolium ventitare
ac iubere aperiri cellam Iovis ibi solum diu demorari, quasi
consultantem de re publica cum Iove: aedituosque eius templi saepe esse
miratos, quod eum id temporis in Capitolium ingredientem canes, semper
in alios saevientes, non latrarent. Has vulgi de Scipione opiniones
confirmare atque approbare videbantur dicta factaque eius pleraque
admiranda, ex quibus est unum huiuscemodi. Adsidebat oppugnabatque
oppidum in Hispania, situ moenibusque ac defensoribus validum et
munitum, re etiam cibaria copiosum, neque ulla eius potiundi spes erat.
Quodam die ius in castris sedens dicebat Scipio atque ex eo loco id
oppidum procul videbatur. Tum e militibus, qui in iure apud eum stabant,
interrogavit quispiam ex more in quem diem locumque vades sisti iuberet.
Et Scipio manum ad ipsam oppidi, quod obsidebatur, arcem protendens,
“Perendie” inquit “sese sistant illo in loco,” atque ita factum. Die
tertia, in quam vades sisti iusserat, oppidum captum est. Eodem die in
arce eius oppidi ius dixit.

Hannibal, a Scipione victus suisque invisus, ad Antiochum, Syriae regem,
confugit eumque hostem Romanis fecit. Missi sunt Roma legati ad
Antiochum, in quibus erat Scipio Africanus, qui cum Hannibale Ephesi
conlocutus ab eo quaesivit, quem fuisse maximum imperatorem crederet.
Respondit Hannibal Alexandrum, Macedonum regem, maximum sibi videri,
quod parva manu innumerabiles exercitus fudisset. Quaerenti deinde, quem
secundum poneret, “Pyrrhum” inquit, “quod primus castra metari docuit
nemoque illo elegantius loca cepit et praesidia deposuit.” Sciscitanti
denique quem tertium duceret, semet ipsum dixit. Tum ridens Scipio
“Quidnam tu diceres” inquit “si me vicisses?” “Tum me vero” respondit
Hannibal “et ante Alexandrum et ante Pyrrhum et ante omnes alios
imperatores posuissem.” Ita improviso adsentationis genere Scipionem e
grege imperatorum velut inaestimabilem secernebat.

Scipio ipse fertur quondam dixisse, cum eum quidam parum pugnacem
dicerent, “Imperatorem me mater, non bellatorem peperit.” Idem dicere
solitus est non solum dandam esse viam fugientibus, sed etiam muniendam.

Decreto adversus Antiochum bello cum Syria provincia obvenisset Lucio
Scipioni, quia parum in eo putabatur esse animi, parum roboris, senatus
gerendi huius belli curam mandari volebat conlegae eius C. Laelio.
Surgens tunc Scipio Africanus, frater maior Lucii Scipionis, illam
familiae ignominiam deprecatus est: dixit in fratre suo summam esse
virtutem, summum consilium seque ei legatum fore promisit. Quod cum ab
eo esset dictum, nihil est de Lucii Scipionis provincia commutatum:
itaque frater natu maior minori legatus in Asiam profectus est et tam
diu eum consilio operaque adiuvit, donec triumphum ille et cognomen
Asiatici peperisset.

Eodem bello filius Scipionis Africani captus est et ad Antiochum
deductus. Benigne et liberaliter adulescentem rex habuit, quamquam ab
eius patre tum maxime finibus imperii pellebatur. Cum deinde pacem
Antiochus a Romanis peteret, legatus eius Publium Scipionem adiit eique
filium sine pretio redditurum regem dixit, si per eum pacem impetrasset.
Cui Scipio respondit “Abi, nuntia regi, me pro tanto munere gratias
agere; sed nunc aliam gratiam non possum referre, quam ut ei suadeam ut
bello absistat et pacis condicionem nullam recuset.” Pax non convenit;
tamen Antiochus Scipioni filium remisit tantique viri maiestatem
venerari quam dolorem suum ulcisci maluit.

Victo Antiocho cum praedae ratio a L. Scipione reposceretur, Africanus
prolatum ab eo librum, quo acceptae et expensae summae continebantur et
refelli inimicorum accusatio poterat, discerpsit, indignatus de ea re
dubitari, quae sub ipso legato administrata esset. Quin etiam hunc in
modum verba fecit: “Non est quod quaeratis, patres conscripti, num
parvam pecuniam in aerarium rettulerim, qui antea illud Punico auro
repleverim, neque mea innocentia potest in dubium vocari. Cum Africam
totam potestati vestrae subiecerim, nihil ex ea praeter cognomen
rettuli. Non igitur me Punicae, non fratrem meum Asiaticae gazae avarum
reddiderunt; sed uterque nostrum invidia quam pecunia est locupletior.”
Tam constantem defensionem Scipionis universus senatus comprobavit.

Deinde Scipioni Africano duo tribuni plebis diem dixerunt, quod praeda
ex Antiocho capta aerarium fraudasset. Ubi causae dicendae dies venit,
Scipio magna hominum frequentia in Forum est deductus. Iussus causam
dicere rostra conscendit et, corona triumphali capiti suo imposita, “Hoc
ego die” inquit “Hannibalem Poenum, imperio nostro inimicissimum, magno
proelio vici in terra Africa pacemque nobis et victoriam peperi
insperabilem. Ne igitur simus adversus deos ingrati, sed censeo
relinquamus nebulones hos eamusque nunc protinus in Capitolium Iovi
optimo maximo supplicatum.” A rostris in Capitolium ascendit; simul se
universa contio ab accusatoribus avertit et secuta Scipionem est, nec
quisquam praeter praeconem, qui reum citabat, cum tribunis remansit.
Celebratior is dies favore hominum fuit, quam quo triumphans de Syphace
rege et Carthaginiensibus urbem est ingressus. Inde, ne amplius
tribuniciis iniuriis vexaretur, in Literninum concessit, ubi reliquam
egit aetatem sine urbis desiderio.

Cum in Liternina villa se contineret, complures praedonum duces ad eum
videndum forte confluxerunt. Quos cum ad vim faciendam venire
existimasset, praesidium servorum in tecto conlocavit aliaque parabat,
quae ad eos repellendos opus erant. Quod ubi praedones animadverterunt,
abiectis armis ianuae appropinquant et clara voce nuntiant Scipioni se
non vitae eius hostes, sed virtutis admiratores venisse, conspectum
tanti viri, quasi caeleste aliquod beneficium, expetentes; proinde ne
gravaretur se spectandum praebere. Haec postquam audivit Scipio, fores
reserari eosque introduci iussit. Illi postes ianuae tamquam
religiosissimam aram venerati, cupide Scipionis dextram apprehenderunt
ac diu deosculati sunt; deinde positis ante vestibulum donis laeti, quod
sibi Scipionem ut viderent contigisset, domum reverterunt. Paulo post
mortuus est Scipio moriensque ab uxore petiit ne corpus suum Romam
referretur.

  Pūblius Cornēlius Scīpiō[2] nōndum annōs
  pueritiae ēgressus patrem singulārī virtūte
  servāvit; quī[3] cum pūgnā[4] apud Tīcīnum[5]
  contrā Hannibalem commissā graviter vulnerātus
  in hostium manūs iam iam[6] ventūrus                               {5}
  esset, fīlius interiectō[7] corpore Poenīs inruentibus
  sē opposuit et patrem perīculō līberāvit.
  Quae[8] pietās Scīpiōnī posteā aedīlitātem
  petentī favōrem populī conciliāvit. Cum obsisterent
  tribūnī plēbis, negantēs[9] ratiōnem ēius esse habendam,          {10}
  quod nōndum ad petendum lēgitima[10] aetās esset, “Sī mē” inquit
  Scīpiō “omnēs Quirītēs aedīlem facere volunt, satis annōrum
  habeō.” Tantō inde favōre ad suffrāgia itum[11] est, ut tribūnī
  inceptō dēsisterent.

  Post clādem Cannēnsem Rōmānī exercitūs reliquiae Canusium         {15}
  perfūgerant; cumque ibi tribūnī mīlitum quattuor essent, tamen
  omnium cōnsēnsū ad Pūblium Scīpiōnem, admodum[12] adulēscentem,
  summa imperiī dēlāta est. Quibus cōnsultantibus nūntiat
    [[53]]
  Pūblius Fūrius Philus, cōnsulāris virī fīlius, nōbilēs quōsdam
  iuvenēs propter dēspērātiōnem cōnsilium dē Italiā dēserendā       {20}
  inīre. Statim in hospitium Metellī, quī cōnspīrātiōnis erat prīnceps,
  sē contulit Scīpiō, et cum concilium ibi iuvenum, dē quibus
  adlātum[1] erat, invēnisset, strictō super cāpita cōnsultantium
  gladiō, “Iūrāte” inquit “vōs neque ipsōs rem pūblicam populī
  Rōmānī dēsertūrōs, neque alium cīvem Rōmānum dēserere             {25}
  passūrōs[2]: quī[3] nōn iūrāverit, in sē hunc gladium strictum esse
  sciat.”[4] Haud[5] secus pavidī, quam sī victōrem Hannibalem
  cernerent,[6] iūrant omnēs cūstōdiendōsque sēmet ipsōs Scīpiōnī
  trādunt.

  [Sidenote: B.C. 212.]

  Cum Rōmānī duās clādēs in Hispāniā accēpissent duoque ibi         {30}
  summī imperātōrēs[7] intrā diēs trīgintā cecidissent, placuit[8]
  exercitum augērī eōque prōcōnsulem mittī; nec tamen
  quem mitterent[9] satis cōnstābat. Eā dē rē indicta sunt comitia.
  Prīmō populus exspectābat ut, quī sē tantō dīgnōs imperiō         {34}
  crēderent,[10] nōmina profitērentur; sed nēmō audēbat illud imperium
  suscipere. Maesta igitur cīvitās ac prope inops[11] cōnsiliī[12]
  comitiōrum diē in campum dēscendit. Subitō P. Cornēlius Scīpiō,
  quattuor et vīgintī fermē annōs nātus, professus sē petere,[13] in
  superiōre, unde[14] cōnspicī posset, locō cōnstitit. In quem
  postquam omnium ōra conversa sunt, ad ūnum omnēs Scīpiōnem in     {40}
  Hispāniā prōcōnsulem esse iussērunt. At postquam animōrum[15]
  impetus resēdit, populum[16] Rōmānum coepit factī paenitēre:
    [[54]]
  aetātī Scīpiōnis māximē diffīdēbant. Quod ubi animadvertit
  Scīpiō, advocātā cōntiōne ita māgnō ēlātōque animō dē bellō,
  quod gerendum esset, disseruit, ut hominēs cūrā līberāret spēque  {45}
  certissimā implēret.

  Profectus igitur in Hispāniam Scīpiō Carthāginem Novam,
  quō[1] diē vēnit, expūgnāvit. Eō[2] congestae[3] erant omnēs paene
  Āfricae et Hispāniae opēs, ibi arma, ibi pecūnia, ibi tōtīus Hispāniae
  obsidēs erant: quibus omnibus potītus est Scīpiō. Inter           {50}
  captīvōs ad eum adducta est eximiae fōrmae adulta virgō. Quam
  ubi comperit inlūstrī locō inter Celtibērōs nātam prīncipīque ēius
  gentis adulēscentī dēspōnsam esse, arcessītīs parentibus et spōnsō
  eam reddidit. Parentēs virginis, quī ad eam redimendam satis[4]
  māgnum aurī pondus attulerant, Scīpiōnem ōrābant ut id ā sē       {55}
  dōnum acciperet. Scīpiō aurum ante pedēs pōnī iūssit vocātōque
  ad sē virginis spōnsō, “Super dōtem” inquit “quam acceptūrus
  ā socerō es, haec tibi ā mē dōtālia dōna accēdent” aurumque
  tollere āc sibi habēre iūssit. Ille domum reversus ad referendam
  Scīpiōnī grātiam Celtibērōs Rōmānīs conciliāvit.                  {60}

  Deinde Scīpiō Hasdrubalem[5] victum[6] ex Hispāniā expulit.
  Castrīs hostium potītus omnem praedam mīlitibus concessit,
  captīvōs[7] Hispānōs sine pretiō domum dīmīsit; Āfrōs vērō vēndī
  iussit. Erat inter eōs puer adultus rēgiī generis,[8] fōrmā       {64}
  īnsīgnī[8]: quem cum percontārētur Scīpiō quis et cūiās esset, et
  cūr id[9] aetātis in castrīs fuisset, “Numida sum” inquit puer,
  “Massīvam populārēs vocant: orbus ā patre relīctus, apud avum
  māternum, Numidiae rēgem, ēducātus sum. Cum avunculō Masinissā,
  quī nūper subsidiō Carthāginiēnsibus vēnit, in Hispāniam
    [[55]]
  trāiēcī; prohibitus propter aetātem ā Masinissā numquam ante      {70}
  proelium iniī. Eō diē, quō pūgnātum est cum Rōmānīs, īnsciō
  avunculō, clam armīs equōque sūmptō, in aciem exiī: ibi, prōlāpsō
  equō, captus sum ā Rōmānīs.” Scīpiō eum interrogat velletne[1]
  ad avunculum revertī. Cum, effūsīs[2] gaudiō lacrimīs, id
  vērō sē cupere puer dīceret, tum Scīpiō puerō ānulum aureum       {75}
  equumque ōrnātum dōnat datīsque quī[3] tūtō dēdūcerent equitibus
  dīmīsit.

  Cum Pūblius Cornēlius Scīpiō sē ergā Hispānōs clēmenter gessisset,
  circumfūsa multitūdō eum rēgem ingentī cōnsēnsū appellāvit;
  at Scīpiō, silentiō per praecōnem factō, “Nōmen imperātōris”      {80}
  inquit, “quō[4] mē meī mīlitēs appellārunt, mihi[5] māximum est:
  rēgium[6] nōmen, alibī māgnum, Rōmae intolerābile est. Sī id
  amplissimum iūdicātis, quod rēgāle est, vōbīs licet exīstimāre rēgālem
  in mē esse animum; sed ōrō vōs ut ā rēgis appellātiōne abstineātis.”
  Sēnsēre etiam barbarī māgnitūdinem animī, quā Scīpiō id           {85}
  āspernābātur, quod cēterī mortālēs admīrantur et concupīscunt.

  [Sidenote: B.C. 206.]

  Scīpiō receptā Hispāniā cum iam bellum in ipsam Āfricam
  trānsferre meditārētur, conciliandōs[7] prius rēgum et gentium
  animōs exīstimāvit. Syphācem, Maurōrum rēgem, opulentissimum
  tōtīus Āfricae rēgem, quem[8] māgnō ūsuī[9] sibi[9] fore[10] spērāret,
  prīmum tentāre statuit. Itaque lēgātum cum dōnīs ad eum mīsit     {91}
  C. Laelium, quōcum intimā familiāritāte vīvēbat. Syphāx amīcitiam
  Rōmānōrum sē accipere adnuit, sed fidem nec dare
  nec accipere, nisi cum ipsō cōram duce Rōmānō, voluit.
  Scīpiō igitur in Āfricam trāiēcit. Forte ita incidit, ut eō ipsō  {95}
    [[56]]
  tempore Hasdrubal[1] pulsus Hispāniā ad eundem portum appelleret,[2]
  Syphācis amīcitiam pariter petītūrus.[3] Uterque ā rēge in
  hospitium invītātus. Cēnātum[4] simul apud rēgem est; eōdem
  etiam lectō[5] Scīpiō atque Hasdrubal accubuērunt. Tanta autem
  inerat cōmitās in Scīpiōne, ut nōn Syphācem modo, sed etiam      {100}
  hostem īnfēstissimum Hasdrubalem sibi conciliāret. Scīpiō, foedere
  īctō cum Syphāce, in Hispāniam ad exercitum rediit.

  Masinissa quoque amīcitiam cum Scīpiōne iungere iam dūdum[6]
  cupiēbat. Quārē ad eum trēs Numidārum prīncipēs mīsit ad         {104}
  tempus locumque conloquiō statuendum. Duōs prō obsidibus retinērī
  ā Scīpiōne iubet; remissō tertiō, quī Masinissam ad locum
  cōnstitūtum addūceret, Scīpiō et Masinissa cum paucīs in
  conloquium vēnērunt. Cēperat iam ante Numidam ex fāmā rērum
  gestārum admīrātiō virī, sed māior praesentis[7] venerātiō cēpit:
  erat enim in vultū māiestās summa; accēdēbat prōmissa caesariēs  {110}
  habitusque corporis, nōn cultus[8] munditiīs, sed virīlis vērē ac
  mīlitāris, et flōrēns iuventa. Prope attonitus ipsō congressū
  Numida grātiās dē[9] fīliō frātris remissō agit: adfīrmat sē ex eō
  tempore eam quaesīvisse[10] occāsiōnem, quam tandem oblātam[11]
  nōn omīserit; cupere sē illī et populō Rōmānō operam nāvāre.  {115|
  Laetus eum Scīpiō audīvit atque in societātem recēpit.

  Scīpiō deinde Rōmam rediit et ante annōs[12] cōnsul factus est.
  Sicilia eī prōvincia dēcrēta est permissumque ut in Āfricam inde
    [[57]]
  trāiceret. Quī cum vellet ex fortissimīs peditibus Rōmānīs
  trecentōrum equitum numerum complēre, nec posset illōs subitō    {120}
  armīs et equīs īnstruere, id prūdentī cōnsiliō perfēcit. Namque
  ex omnī Siciliā trecentōs iuvenēs nōbilissimōs et dītissimōs, quī
  equīs mīlitārent[1] et sēcum in Āfricam trāicerent,[1] lēgit diemque
  iīs ēdīxit, quā[2] equīs armīsque īnstrūctī atque ōrnātī adessent.[1]
  Gravis ea mīlitia, procul domō, terrā marīque multōs labōrēs,    {125}
  māgna perīcula adlātūra vidēbātur; neque ipsōs modo, sed parentēs
  cōgnātōsque eōrum ea cūra angēbat. Ubi diēs quae dicta
  erat advēnit, arma equōsque ostendērunt, sed omnēs ferē
  longinquum et grave bellum horrēre appārēbat. Tunc Scīpiō mīlitiam
  iīs sē remissūrum ait, sī arma et equōs mīlitibus Rōmānīs        {130}
  voluissent[3] trādere. Laetī condiciōnem accēpērunt iuvenēs Siculī.
  Ita Scīpiō sine pūblicā impēnsā suōs īnstrūxit ōrnāvitque equitēs.

  Tunc Scīpiō ex Siciliā in Āfricam ventō secundō profectus est
  tantō mīlitum ārdōre, ut nōn ad bellum dūcī vidērentur, sed ad
  certa victōriae praemia. Celeriter nāvēs ē cōnspectū Siciliae    {135}
  ablātae sunt cōnspectaque brevī Āfricae lītora. Scīpiō cum ēgrediēns
  ad terram nāvī prōlāpsus esset et ob hōc attonitōs mīlitēs
  cerneret, id, quod trepidātiōnem adferēbat, in hortātiōnem convertēns,
  “Āfricam oppressī” inquit, “mīlitēs!” Expositīs cōpiīs in        {139}
  proximīs tumulīs castra mētātus[4] est. Ibi speculātōrēs hostium
  in castrīs dēprehēnsōs[5] et ad sē perductōs[5] nec suppliciō adfēcit
  nec dē cōnsiliīs ac vīribus Poenōrum percontātus est, sed circā
  omnēs Rōmānī exercitūs manipulōs cūrāvit dēdūcendōs; dein
  interrogātōs[6] num ea satis cōnsīderāssent, quae speculārī erant

  Scīpiōnī in Āfricam advenientī Masinissa sē coniūnxit cum

  Haec et aliae, quae sequēbantur, clādēs Carthāginiēnsibus

  Hannibal, ā Scīpiōne victus suīsque invīsus, ad Antiochum,       {210}
  Syriae rēgem, cōnfūgit eumque hostem Rōmānīs fēcit. Missī
  sunt Rōmā lēgātī ad Antiochum, in quibus erat Scīpiō Āfricānus,
  quī cum Hannibale Ephesī[5] conlocūtus ab eō quaesīvit, quem
  fuisse māximum imperātōrem crēderet. Respondit Hannibal
  Alexandrum, Macedonum rēgem, māximum sibi vidērī, quod           {215}
  parvā manū innumerābilēs exercitūs fūdisset. Quaerentī deinde,
  quem secundum pōneret, “Pyrrhum” inquit, “quod prīmus castra[6]

  dēposuit.” Scīscitantī dēnique quem tertium dūceret, sēmet ipsum
  dīxit. Tum rīdēns Scīpiō “Quidnam tū dīcerēs[9]” inquit “sī mē   {220}
  vīcissēs[9]?” “Tum[10] mē vērō” respondit Hannibal “et ante
  Alexandrum et ante Pyrrhum et ante omnēs aliōs imperātōrēs
  posuissem.[9]” Ita imprōvīsō adsentātiōnis genere Scīpiōnem ē
  grege imperātōrum velut inaestimābilem sēcernēbat.

    [[61]]
  Scīpiō ipse fertur quondam dīxisse, cum eum quīdam parum         {225}
  pūgnācem dīcerent, “Imperātōrem mē māter, nōn bellātōrem[1]

  Dēcrētō adversus Antiochum bellō[3] cum Syria prōvincia          {229}

  parum rōboris,[4] senātus gerendī hūius bellī cūram mandārī volēbat
  conlēgae ēius C. Laeliō. Surgēns tunc Scīpiō Āfricānus,
  frāter māior Lūciī Scīpiōnis, illam familiae īgnōminiam
  dēprecātus est: dīxit in frātre suō summam esse virtūtem, summum
  cōnsilium sēque eī lēgātum fore prōmīsit. Quod cum ab eō esset   {235}
  dictum, nihil[5] est dē Lūciī Scīpiōnis prōvinciā commūtātum:
  itaque frāter nātū māior minōrī lēgātus in Asiam profectus est
  et tam diū eum cōnsiliō operāque adiūvit, dōnec triumphum ille
  et cōgnōmen Asiāticī peperisset.

  Eōdem bellō fīlius Scīpiōnis Āfricānī captus est et ad Antiochum
  dēductus. Benīgnē et līberāliter adulēscentem rēx habuit,[6]     {241}
  quamquam ab ēius patre tum[7] māximē fīnibus imperiī pellēbātur.
  Cum deinde pācem Antiochus ā Rōmānīs peteret, lēgātus ēius
  Pūblium Scīpiōnem adiit eīque fīlium sine pretiō redditūrum
  rēgem dīxit, sī per eum pācem impetrāsset.[8] Cuī Scīpiō respondit
  “Abī, nūntiā rēgī, mē prō tantō mūnere grātiās[9] agere; sed     {246}
  nunc aliam grātiam nōn possum referre, quam ut eī suādeam[10] ut

  discerpsit, indīgnātus[3] dē eā rē dubitārī, quae sub ipsō lēgātō

  “Nōn[5] est quod quaerātis, patrēs cōnscrīptī, num parvam pecūniam
  in aerārium rettulerim, quī anteā illud Pūnicō aurō replēverim,
  neque mea innocentia potest in dubium vocārī. Cum
  Āfricam tōtam potestātī vestrae subiēcerim, nihil ex eā praeter

    (p. 30, n. 2) with #id#.
    55.1: Why is #vellet# subjunctive?
    55.2: #effūsīs# (_effundō_) . . . #lacrimīs#: ‘with tears of joy.’

    60.2: #in . . . iubēret#: ‘when and where he bade (the accused)
    appear for trial.’ #vadēs sistī# is the passive of _vadēs
    sistere_, a legal phrase = ‘to make one’s bail stand,’ i.e. to
    make it effective, and so ‘to stand trial.’ _Sistere_ often means
    ‘to produce in court,’ as in l. 207.
    60.3: #sēsē sistant#: ‘let them produce themselves,’ i.e. appear
    for trial.

    61.2: _pariō_.
    61.3: This war lasted from 192 to 190.

    it was an adverb.
    61.5: #nihil . . . commūtātum#: ‘no change was made.’ Note that
    #nihil# is an adverbial acc. of degree, and that #commūtātum est#

    61.8: Explain mood and tense.

    62.5: #Nōn . . . quaerātis#: ‘there is no reason why you should
    ask’; lit., ‘there is not (anything) as to which,’ etc. H 591, 4
    (503, 1, N. 2): M 836: A 320, _a_: G 631, 2: B 283, 2.

    partitive gen.

    63.2: #quō# (sc. _diē_) = _eō diē quō_.

    63.4: #cōnspectum . . . expetentēs#: ‘craving a chance to see so
    great a man, as a sort of heaven-sent favor.’
    63.5: #nē . . . gravārētur#: the subjunctive is used here in
    indir. disc., as representing an imperative of the direct: H 642,

#XXII. Tiberius Gracchus et Gaius Gracchus# [[stripped text]]

Tiberius et Gaius Gracchi Scipionis Africani ex filia nepotes erant.
Horum adulescentia bonis artibus et magna omnium spe exacta est: ad
egregiam enim indolem optima accedebat educatio. Erant enim diligentia
Corneliae matris a pueris docti et Graecis litteris eruditi. Maximum
matronis ornamentum esse liberos bene institutos merito putabat mater
illa sapientissima. Cum Campana matrona, apud illam hospita, ornamenta
sua, illo saeculo pulcherrima, ostentaret ei muliebriter, Cornelia
traxit eam sermone quousque e schola redirent liberi. Quos reversos
hospitae ostendens, “Haec” inquit “mea ornamenta sunt.” Nihil quidem his
adulescentibus neque a natura neque a doctrina defuit; sed ambo rem
publicam, quam tueri poterant, perturbare maluerunt.

Tiberius Gracchus, tribunus plebis creatus, a senatu descivit: populi
favorem profusis largitionibus sibi conciliavit; agros plebi dividebat;
provincias novis coloniis replebat. Cum autem tribuniciam potestatem
sibi prorogari vellet et palam dictitasset, interempto senatu omnia per
plebem agi debere, viam sibi ad regnum parare videbatur. Quare cum
convocati patres deliberarent quidnam faciendum esset, statim Tiberius
Capitolium petit, manum ad caput referens, quo signo salutem suam populo
commendabat. Hoc nobilitas ita accepit, quasi diadema posceret,
segniterque cessante consule, Scipio Nasica, cum esset consobrinus
Tiberii Gracchi, patriam cognationi praeferens sublata dextra
proclamavit: “Qui rem publicam salvam esse volunt, me sequantur!” Dein
optimates, senatus atque equestris ordinis pars maior in Gracchum
inruunt, qui fugiens decurrensque Clivo Capitolino fragmento subsellii
ictus vitam, quam gloriosissime degere potuerat, immatura morte finivit.
Mortui Tiberii corpus in flumen proiectum est.

Gaium Gracchum idem furor, qui fratrem, Tiberium, occupavit. Tribunatum
enim adeptus, seu vindicandae fraternae necis, seu comparandae regiae
potentiae causa, pessima coepit inire consilia: maximas largitiones
fecit; aerarium effudit: legem de frumento plebi dividendo tulit:
civitatem omnibus Italicis dabat. His Gracchi consiliis quanta poterant
contentione obsistebant omnes boni, in quibus maxime Piso, vir
consularis. Is cum multa contra legem frumentariam dixisset, lege tamen
lata ad frumentum cum ceteris accipiendum venit. Gracchus ubi
animadvertit in contione Pisonem stantem, eum sic compellavit audiente
populo Romano: “Qui tibi constas, Piso, cum ea lege frumentum petas,
quam dissuasisti?” Cui Piso “Nolim quidem, Gracche” inquit, “mea bona
tibi viritim dividere liceat; sed si facies, partem petam.” Quo responso
aperte declaravit vir gravis et sapiens lege, quam tulerat Gracchus,
patrimonium publicum dissipari.

Decretum a senatu est ut videret consul Opimius ne quid detrimenti res
publica caperet: quod nisi in maximo discrimine decerni non solebat.
Gaius Gracchus, armata familia, Aventinum occupavit. Consul, vocato ad
arma populo, Gaium aggressus est, qui pulsus profugit et, cum iam
comprehenderetur, iugulum servo praebuit, qui dominum et mox semet ipsum
super domini corpus interemit. Ut Tiberii Gracchi antea corpus, ita Gaii
mira crudelitate victorum in Tiberim deiectum est. Caput autem a
Septimuleio, amico Gracchi, ad Opimium relatum auro repensum fertur.
Sunt qui tradunt infuso plumbo eum partem capitis, quo gravius
efficeretur, explesse.

Occiso Tiberio Graccho cum senatus consulibus mandasset, ut in eos, qui
cum Graccho consenserant, animadverteretur, Blosius quidam, Tiberii
amicus, pro se deprecatum venit, hanc, ut sibi ignosceretur, causam
adferens, quod tanti Gracchum fecisset, ut, quidquid ille vellet, sibi
faciendum putaret. Tum consul “Quid?” inquit “si te Gracchus templo
Iovis in Capitolio faces subdere iussisset, obsecuturusne voluntati
illius fuisses propter istam, quam iactas, familiaritatem?” “Numquam”
inquit Blosius “voluisset id quidem, sed si voluisset, paruissem.”
Nefaria est ea vox, nulla enim est excusatio peccati, si amici causa
peccaveris.

Exstat Gaii Gracchi e Sardinia Romam reversi oratio, in qua cum alia tum
haec de se narrat: “Versatus sum in provincia, quomodo ex usu vestro
existimabam esse, non quomodo ambitioni meae conducere arbitrabar. Nemo
possit vere dicere assem aut eo plus in muneribus me accepisse aut mea
causa quemquam sumptum fecisse. Zonas, quas Roma proficiscens plenas
argenti extuli, eas ex provincia inanes rettuli. Alii amphoras, quas
vini plenas extulerunt, eas argento repletas domum reportarunt.”

    [Footnotes: XXII (pages 63-67)

    63.6: When two persons of the same name are mentioned together,
    the cognomen is usually put in the plural.
    63.7: Africanus Maior.
    63.8: Her brother was the adoptive father of the younger Scipio
    Africanus. The Gracchi were thus connected with two of the most
    distinguished of the Roman clans, the Cornelian and the Aemilian.
    64.1: #ā puerīs#: we say, ‘from _childhood_.’
    64.2: ‘literature’; abl. of means.
    64.3: ‘guest.’
    64.4: #illō saeculō#: temporal abl. We say: ‘for that age.’ The
    writer of these words was familiar with the extraordinary luxury
    and extravagance that marked the later history of Rome.
    64.5: ‘with womanish pride.’ A tone of contempt often attaches to
    _mulier_ and its derivatives.
    64.6: construed here like _dōnec_, p. 39, n. 9.
    64.7: Cf. p. 28, n. 3.
    64.8: #sed . . . māluērunt#: this whole account of the Gracchi was
    manifestly written by one who sympathized with the senatorial or
    aristocratic party. Modern scholars are divided in their
    interpretations of the motives of the Gracchi.
    64.9: The reference is to the _ager pūblicus_, or land gained in
    conquest. It belonged in theory to the state, but the greater part
    of it had fallen into the hands of wealthy capitalists, who,
    though possessing no legal title to the land, yet regarded it as
    their own, and resented any attempt to interfere with their
    occupancy. Meanwhile, the number of small landholders was
    constantly decreasing. These circumstances tended to drive numbers
    of poor people to the cities, especially Rome. The universal
    employment of slave labor aggravated the trouble by shutting the
    poor out from honest labor. Tiberius attempted to remedy these
    evils by limiting the number of acres of the public land which
    might be held by any individual and by distributing the lands thus
    redeemed among the poorer classes.
    64.10: These colonies were intended to aid in relieving the
    distress at Rome by removing part of the population and supplying
    such persons with lands.
    64.11: It was a general rule that no magistrate should hold the
    same office for two successive terms. Thus no man could be
    reëlected consul until ten years after the expiration of the first
    term. When Tiberius, at the end of his year as tribune, presented
    himself for reëlection, the aristocrats appealed to this rule.
    Gracchus might have replied that the rule had often been set aside
    under special circumstances. Still, on the whole, his conduct
    seems to have been unconstitutional.
    65.1: This statement is probably wholly false. As the champions of
    the poor against the rich, the Gracchi were hated by the
    aristocrats, and received no favors at the hands of Roman
    historians.
    65.2: #Hōc . . . pōsceret#: ‘The nobles interpreted this to mean
    that he was demanding a kingly crown.’ #pōsceret# is subjunctive
    as giving in indirect discourse the thought of the nobles; cf.
    p. 3, n. 6.
    65.3: ‘although.’
    65.4: See Vocab., _equestris_ and _eques_.
    65.5: #dēgere potuerat#: ‘he might have spent.’ Cf. _tuērī
    poterant_, l. 12.
    65.6: _adipīscor_.
    65.7: #aerārium effūdit#: ‘he wasted (the money in) the treasury.’
    The reference is to the corn law mentioned in the next sentence.
    This entitled all citizens residing in Rome to a certain measure
    of corn monthly for less than the market price. The distribution
    was thus a constant drain upon the treasury.
    65.8: ‘citizenship.’
    65.9: ‘tried to give.’ The imperfect tense, like the present,
    often denotes attempted action; cf. _dīvidēbat_, l. 16, and
    _commendābat_, l. 22. He was unable to carry the law, as the
    citizens of Rome itself were jealous of any extension of the
    franchise. The Italians did not obtain citizenship till 89 B.C.
    65.10: #quantā . . . contentiōne#: ‘with the greatest possible
    energy.’ Cf. _quantō potuit apparātū_, IX, 39, and note.
    66.1: #omnēs bonī#: ‘all loyal citizens.’ _bonī_, like
    _optimātēs_, often has this political meaning. Cf. the derivation
    of _aristocracy_.
    66.2: Sc. _obsistēbat_.
    66.3: #Quī . . . cōnstās#: ‘How do you explain your conduct?’ How
    literally? See (4) _quī_ in vocabulary.
    66.4: #Nōlim#: ‘I should hardly desire’; lit. ‘I should be
    unwilling.’ The subjunctive is often thus used in a modest
    assertion: H 556 (486, N. 1): M 719: A 311, _b_: G 257, 2: B 280,
    1. Cf. _possit_, l. 72. Often, as here, the modesty is assumed
    ironically.
    66.5: Join with #liceat#.
    66.6: #ut . . . caperet#: this was the formula by which the senate
    conferred unlimited power upon the consuls. Explain the
    subjunctives #vidēret# and #caperet#, and give the words of the
    decree as passed by the senate.
    66.7: here ‘household.’
    66.8: #iam comprehenderētur#: ‘was on the point of being
    arrested.’
    66.9: #aurō . . . fertur#: ‘is said to have been paid for with
    gold.’
    66.10: #Sunt quī trādunt#: ‘there are (those) who relate,’ i.e.
    ‘some say.’
    66.11: #infūsō plumbō#: ‘by pouring in lead.’ Cf. p. xxiii, K 8.
    It is said that Opimius had promised to pay its weight in gold for
    the head of Gaius.
    66.12: = _explēvisse_.
    67.1: #in eōs . . . animadverterētur#: ‘punishment should be
    visited upon those.’
    67.2: Cf. p. xviii, E 6.
    67.3: #ut . . . īgnōscerētur#: a result clause, dependent on
    #causam#: ‘a reason as a result of which he _ought to be
    pardoned_.’ The subjunctive at times expresses necessity or
    obligation and propriety.
    67.4: #tantī . . . fēcisset#: ‘he had so highly esteemed
    Gracchus.’ #tantī# is a so-called gen. of price or value: H 448, 1
    (405): M 576: A 252, _a_: G 380: B 203, 3. For _fēcisset_, cf.
    p. 14, n. 1.
    67.5: Cf. p. 47, n. 12.
    67.6: #quidem# emphasizes #id#. This emphasis in English would be
    indicated by the stress of the voice, thus: ‘he never would have
    dreamed of _that_.’ Cf. _Nōlim quidem_ above, l. 42.
    67.7: #cum . . . tum#: ‘not only . . . but also.’
    67.8: #ex ūsū vestrō#: ‘to your interests.’
    67.9: ‘a red cent,’ ‘a farthing,’ as we say.
    67.10: _sūmptum facere_ = ‘to be put to expense.’
    67.11: Verbs and adjectives denoting fulness and want are
    construed with either the gen. or the abl., the abl. in reality
    expressing means.]


#XXIII. Gaius Marius# [[stripped text]]

C. Marius, humili loco natus, militiae tirocinium in Hispania duce
Scipione posuit. Erat imprimis Scipioni carus ob singularem virtutem et
impigram ad pericula et labores alacritatem. Cum aliquando inter cenam
Scipionem quidam interrogasset, si quid illi accidisset, quemnam res
publica aeque magnum habitura esset imperatorem, Scipio, percusso
leniter Marii umero, “Fortasse hunc” inquit. Quo dicto excitatus Marius
dignos rebus, quas postea gessit, spiritus concepit.

Q. Metellum in Numidiam contra Iugurtham missum, cuius legatus erat, cum
ab eo Romam missus esset, apud populum Romanum criminatus est bellum
ducere: si se consulem fecissent, brevi tempore aut vivum aut mortuum
Iugurtham se in potestatem populi Romani redacturum. Itaque creatus est
consul et in Metelli locum suffectus. Bellum ab illo prospere coeptum
confecit. Iugurtha ad Gaetulos perfugerat eorumque regem Bocchum
adversus Romanos concitaverat. Marius Gaetulos et Bocchum aggressus
fudit; castellum in excelsa ripa positum, ubi regii thesauri erant, non
sine multo labore expugnavit. Bocchus, bello defessus, legatos ad Marium
misit, pacem orantes. Sulla quaestor, a Mario ad regem remissus, Boccho
persuasit ut Iugurtham Romanis traderet. Iugurtha igitur vinctus ad
Marium deductus est; quem Marius triumphans ante currum egit et in
carcerem caenosum inclusit. Quo cum Iugurtha detracta veste
ingrederetur, os ridentis in modum diduxisse et stupens similisque
desipienti exclamasse fertur: “Pro! quam frigidum est vestrum balneum!”
Paucis diebus post in carcere necatus est.

Marius post bellum Numidicum iterum consul creatus bellumque ei contra
Cimbros et Teutones decretum est. Hi novi hostes, ab extremis Germaniae
finibus profugi, novas sedes quaerebant, exclusique Gallia et Hispania
cum in Italiam remigrarent, a Romanis ut aliquid sibi terrae darent
petierunt. Repulsi, quod nequiverant precibus, armis petere constituunt.
Tres duces Romani impetus barbarorum non sustinuerunt. Omnes fugati,
exuti castris. Actum erat de imperio Romano, nisi Marius fuisset. Hic
primo Teutones sub ipsis Alpium radicibus adsecutus proelio oppressit.
Vallem fluviumque medium hostes tenebant: Romanis aquarum nulla copia.
Aucta necessitate virtus causa victoriae fuit. Nam flagitante aquam
exercitu Marius “Viri” inquit “estis, en illic aquam habetis.” Itaque
tanto ardore pugnatum est eaque caedes hostium fuit, ut Romani victores
de cruento flumine non plus aquae biberent quam sanguinis barbarorum.
Caesa traduntur hostium ducenta milia, capta nonaginta. Rex ipse
Teutobochus in proximo saltu comprehensus insigne spectaculum triumphi
fuit: quippe vir proceritatis eximiae super tropaea ipsa eminebat.

Deletis Teutonibus, C. Marius in Cimbros se convertit. Qui cum ex alia
parte Italiam ingressi Athesim flumen non ponte nec navibus, sed
iniectis arborum truncis, velut aggere, traiecissent, occurrit iis C.
Marius. Cimbri legatos ad consulem miserunt, agros urbesque sibi et
fratribus postulantes, Teutonum enim cladem ignorabant. Quaerente Mario
quos illi fratres dicerent, cum Teutones nominassent, ridens Marius
“Omittite” inquit “fratres; tenent hi acceptam a nobis terram
aeternumque tenebunt.” Tum legati se ludibrio haberi sentientes ultionem
Mario minati sunt, simul atque Teutones advenissent. “Atqui adsunt”
inquit Marius “nec sane civile foret vos fratribus vestris non salutatis
discedere.” Tum vinctos adduci iussit Teutonum duces, qui in proelio
capti erant.

His rebus auditis, Cimbri egrediuntur castris et cum paucis suorum ad
vallum Romanum adequitans Boiorix, Cimbrorum dux, Marium ad pugnam
provocat et diem pugnae a Romanorum imperatore petit. Proximum dedit
consul. Marius cum aciem ita instituisset, ut pulvis in oculos et ora
hostium ferretur, incredibili strage prostrata est illa Cimbrorum
multitudo: caesa traduntur centum octoginta hominum milia. Nec minor cum
uxoribus pugna quam cum viris fuit, cum obiectis undique plaustris,
desuper, quasi e turribus, lanceis contisque pugnarent. Victae tamen cum
missa ad Marium legatione libertatem non impetrassent, suffocatis
elisisque infantibus suis aut mutuis conciderunt vulneribus aut vinculo
e crinibus suis facto ab arboribus pependerunt. Canes quoque defendere,
Cimbris caesis, eorum domos. Marius pro duobus triumphis, qui
offerebantur, uno contentus fuit. Primores civitatis, qui ei aliquamdiu
ut novo homini ad tantos honores evecto inviderant, conservatam ab eo
rem publicam fatebantur. In ipsa acie Marius duas Camertium cohortes,
mira virtute vim Cimbrorum sustinentes contra legem civitate donaverat.
Quod quidem factum et vere et egregie postea excusavit, dicens inter
armorum strepitum verba se iuris civilis exaudire non potuisse.

Illa tempestate primum Romae bellum civile commotum est. Causam bello
dedit C. Marius. Cum enim Sulla consul contra Mithridatem, regem Ponti,
missus fuisset, Sulpicius, tribunus plebis, legem ad populum tulit ut
Sullae imperium abrogaretur, C. Mario bellum decerneretur Mithridaticum.
Qua re Sulla commotus cum exercitu ad urbem venit, eam armis occupavit,
Sulpicium interfecit, Marium fugavit. Marius hostes persequentes fugiens
aliquamdiu in palude delituit. Sed paulo post repertus extractusque, ut
erat nudo corpore caenoque oblitus, iniecto in collum loro Minturnas
raptus et in custodiam coniectus est. Missus est ad eum occidendum
servus publicus, natione Cimber, quem Marius vultus auctoritate
deterruit. Cum enim hominem ad se stricto gladio venientem vidisset
“Tune, homo,” inquit “C. Marium audebis occidere?” Quo audito attonitus
ille ac tremens abiecto ferro fugit, Marium se non posse occidere
clamitans. Marius deinde ab iis, qui prius eum occidere voluerant,
e carcere emissus est.

Accepta navicula in Africam traiecit et in agrum Carthaginiensem
pervenit. Ibi cum in locis solitariis sederet, venit ad eum lictor
Sextilii praetoris, qui tum Africam obtinebat. Ab hoc, quem numquam
laesisset, Marius humanitatis tamen aliquod officium exspectabat; at
lictor decedere eum provincia iussit, nisi in se animadverti vellet:
torveque intuentem et vocem nullam emittentem Marium rogavit tandem
ecquid renuntiari praetori vellet? Marius “Abi” inquit, “nuntia vidisse
te Gaium Marium in Carthaginis ruinis sedentem.” Duobus clarissimis
exemplis de inconstantia rerum humanarum eum admonebat, cum et urbis
maximae excidium et viri clarissimi casum ante oculos poneret.

Profecto ad bellum Mithridaticum Sulla, Marius revocatus a Cinna in
Italiam rediit, efferatus magis calamitate quam domitus. Cum exercitu
Romam ingressus eam caedibus et rapinis vastavit; omnes adversae
factionis nobiles variis suppliciorum generibus adfecit: quinque dies
continuos totidemque noctes illa scelerum omnium duravit licentia. Hoc
tempore admiranda sane populi Romani abstinentia fuit. Cum enim Marius
occisorum domos multitudini diripiendas obiecisset, inveniri potuit
nemo, qui civili luctu praedam peteret: quae quidem tam misericors
continentia plebis tacita quaedam crudelium victorum vituperatio fuit.
Tandem Marius, senio et laboribus confectus, in morbum incidit et
ingenti omnium laetitia vitam finivit. Cuius viri si examinentur cum
virtutibus vitia, haud facile sit dictu utrum bello melior, an pace
perniciosior fuerit: namque quam rem publicam armatus servavit, eam
primo togatus omni genere fraudis, postremo armis hostiliter evertit.

Erat Marius durior ad humanitatis studia et ingenuarum artium
contemptor. Cum aedem Honoris de manubiis hostium vovisset, spreta
peregrinorum marmorum nobilitate artificumque Graecorum arte, eam
vulgari lapide per artificem Romanum curavit aedificandam. Et Graecas
litteras despiciebat, quod doctoribus suis parum ad virtutem
profuissent. At idem fortis, validus, adversus dolorem confirmatus. Cum
ei varices in crure secarentur, vetuit se adligari. Acrem tamen fuisse
doloris morsum ipse ostendit: nam medico, alterum crus postulanti,
noluit praebere, quod maiorem esse remedii quem morbi dolorem iudicaret.

  Marius post bellum Numidicum iterum cōnsul creātus bellumque

  Omnēs fugātī,[1] exūtī[1] castrīs. Āctum[2] erat dē imperiō Rōmānō,

  medium[5] hostēs tenēbant: Rōmānīs[6] aquārum nūlla cōpia. Aucta
  necessitāte virtūs causa victōriae fuit. Nam flāgitante aquam
  exercitū Marius “Virī[7]” inquit “estis, ēn illīc aquam habētis.”
  Itaque tantō ārdōre pūgnātum est eaque caedēs hostium fuit, ut    {41}

  super tropaea ipsa ēminēbat.

    [Illustration: TROPAEUM]

  Dēlētīs Teutonibus, C. Marius in Cimbrōs sē convertit. Quī
  cum ex[8] aliā parte Ītaliam ingressī Athesim flūmen nōn ponte    {50}
  nec nāvibus, sed iniectīs[9] arborum truncīs, velut aggere,
  trāiēcissent, occurrit iīs C. Marius. Cimbrī lēgātōs ad cōnsulem
  mīsērunt, agrōs urbēsque sibi et frātribus pōstulantēs,[10] Teutonum
  enim clādem īgnōrābant. Quaerente[11] Mariō quōs illī frātrēs
  dīcerent, cum Teutonēs nōmināssent, rīdēns Marius “Omittite[12]”  {55}
  inquit “frātrēs; tenent hī acceptam ā nōbīs terram aeternumque
    [[71]]
  tenēbunt.” Tum lēgātī sē lūdibriō[1] habērī sentientēs ultiōnem
  Mariō minātī sunt, simul atque Teutonēs advēnissent. “Atquī

  nōn salūtātīs discēdere.” Tum vinctōs addūcī iussit Teutonum      {60}
  ducēs, quī in proeliō captī erant.

  Hīs rēbus audītīs, Cimbrī ēgrediuntur castrīs et cum paucīs
  suōrum ad vāllum Rōmānum adequitāns Boiorix, Cimbrōrum
  dux, Marium ad pūgnam prōvocat et diem pūgnae ā Rōmānōrum
  imperātōre petit. Proximum dedit cōnsul. Marius cum aciem         {65}

    [[72]]

  sē iūris cīvīlis exaudīre nōn potuisse.

  [Sidenote: B.C. 88.]

  Illā tempestāte prīmum Rōmae bellum cīvīle commōtum est.
  Causam bellō dedit C. Marius. Cum enim Sulla[1] cōnsul
  contrā Mithridātem,[2] rēgem Pontī, missus fuisset, Sulpicius,    {85}
  tribūnus plēbis, lēgem[3] ad populum tulit ut Sullae imperium
  abrogārētur, C. Mariō bellum dēcernerētur Mithridāticum. Quā rē
  Sulla commōtus cum exercitū ad urbem vēnit, eam armīs occupāvit,
  Sulpicium interfēcit, Marium fugāvit. Marius hostēs persequentēs
  fugiēns aliquamdiū in palūde dēlituit.[4] Sed paulō post          {90}
  repertus extrāctusque, ut erat nūdō corpore caenōque oblitus,[5]
  iniectō in collum lōrō Minturnās raptus et in cūstōdiam coniectus
  est. Missus est ad eum occīdendum servus[6] pūblicus, nātiōne
  Cimber, quem Marius vultūs auctōritāte dēterruit. Cum enim
  hominem ad sē strictō gladiō venientem vīdisset “Tūne, homō,”     {95}
  inquit “C. Marium audēbis occīdere?” Quō audītō attonitus ille
  ac tremēns abiectō ferrō fūgit, Marium sē nōn posse occīdere
  clāmitāns. Marius deinde ab iīs, quī prius eum occīdere voluerant,
  ē carcere ēmissus est.                                            {99}

  Acceptā nāviculā in Āfricam trāiēcit et in agrum Carthāginiēnsem
  pervēnit. Ibi cum in locīs sōlitāriīs[7] sedēret, vēnit ad eum
  līctor Sextiliī praetōris, quī tum Āfricam obtinēbat. Ab hōc,
  quem[8] numquam laesisset, Marius hūmānitātis tamen[9] aliquod
    [[73]]
  officium exspectābat; at līctor dēcēdere eum prōvinciā iussit,   {104}
  nisi in sē animadvertī vellet: torvēque intuentem et vōcem nūllam
  ēmittentem Marium rogāvit tandem ecquid renūntiārī praetōrī
  vellet? Marius “Abī” inquit, “nūntiā vīdisse tē Gāium
  Marium in Carthāginis ruīnīs sedentem.” Duōbus clārissimīs
  exemplīs dē incōnstantiā rērum hūmānārum eum admonēbat,
  cum et urbis māximae excidium et virī clārissimī cāsum ante      {110}
  oculōs pōneret.

  Profectō ad bellum Mithridāticum Sullā, Marius revocātus ā
  Cinnā[1] in Ītaliam rediit, efferātus magis calamitāte quam domitus.
  Cum exercitū Rōmam ingressus eam caedibus et rapīnīs             {114}
  vāstāvit; omnēs adversae factiōnis nōbilēs variīs[2] suppliciōrum
  generibus adfēcit: quīnque diēs continuōs totidemque noctēs illa
  scelerum omnium dūrāvit licentia.[3] Hōc tempore admīranda sānē
  populī Rōmānī abstinentia fuit. Cum enim Marius occīsōrum        {118}
  domōs multitūdinī dīripiendās[4] obiēcisset, invenīrī potuit nēmō,
  quī[5] cīvīlī[6] lūctū praedam peteret[5]: quae quidem tam misericors
  continentia plēbis tacita[7] quaedam crūdēlium victōrum vituperātiō
  fuit. Tandem Marius, seniō et labōribus cōnfectus, in morbum     {122}
  incidit et ingentī[8] omnium laetitiā vītam fīnīvit. Cūius virī sī
  exāminentur cum virtūtibus vitia, haud facile sit dictū[9] utrum
  bellō melior, an pāce perniciōsior fuerit: namque quam rem       {125}
  pūblicam armātus[10] servāvit, eam prīmō togātus[10] omnī genere
      fraudis,
  postrēmō armīs hostīliter ēvertit.

    [[74]]
  Erat Marius dūrior[1] ad hūmānitātis[2] studia et ingenuārum[3]
  artium contemptor. Cum aedem Honōris dē manubiīs hostium         {129}
  vōvisset, sprētā[4] peregrīnōrum marmorum nōbilitāte artificumque
  Graecōrum arte, eam vulgārī lapide[5] per artificem Rōmānum
  cūrāvit aedificandam. Et Graecās litterās dēspiciēbat, quod[6]
  doctōribus suīs parum ad virtūtem prōfuissent. At īdem fortis,
  validus, adversus dolōrem cōnfīrmātus. Cum eī varicēs in crūre
  secārentur, vetuit sē adligārī. Ācrem tamen fuisse dolōris morsum
  ipse ostendit: nam medicō, alterum crūs pōstulantī, nōluit       {136}
  praebēre, quod māiōrem esse remediī quem morbī dolōrem
  iūdicāret.

    B 283, 3.
    72.9: #tamen# looks back to #quī . . . obtinēbat#, l. 102. The
    thought is that Marius hoped for some kindly consideration
    (#hūmānitātis aliquod officium#) from Sextilius, though his

#XXIV. Lucius Cornelius Sulla# [[stripped text]]

138-78 B.C.

Cornelius Sulla cum parvulus a nutrice ferretur, mulier obvia “Salve”
inquit “puer tibi et rei publicae tuae felix,” et statim quaesita quae
haec dixisset, nōn potuit inveniri.

Hic bello Iugurthino quaestor Marii fuit. Qui cum usque ad quaesturae
comitia vitam libidine, vino, ludicrae artis amore inquinatam
perduxisset, C. Marius consul moleste tulisse traditur, quod sibi
gravissimum bellum gerenti tam delicatus quaestor sorte obvenisset.
Eiusdem tamen, postquam in Africam venit, virtus enituit. Bello
Cimbrico, legatus consulis bonam operam navavit. Consul ipse deinde
factus, pulso in exsilium Mario, adversus Mithridatem profectus est.
Mithridates enim, Ponticus rex, vir bello acerrimus, virtute eximius,
odio in Romanos non inferior Hannibale, occupata Asia necatisque in ea
omnibus civibus Romanis, quos quidem eadem die atque hora per omnes
civitates interimi iusserat, Europae quoque Italiaeque imminere
videbatur. Ac primo Sulla illius praefectos duobus proeliis in Graecia
profligavit; dein transgressus in Asiam Mithridatem ipsum fudit; et
oppressisset, nisi ad bellum civile adversus Marium festinans
qualemcumque pacem componere maluisset. Mithridatem tamen pecunia
multavit; Asia aliisque provinciis, quas occupaverat, decedere
paternisque finibus contentum esse coegit.

Sulla propter motus urbanos cum victore exercitu Romam properavit; eos,
qui Mario favebant, omnes superavit. Nihil autem ea victoria fuit
crudelius. Sulla, urbem ingressus et dictator creatus, vel in eos, qui
se sponte dediderant, iussit animadverti. Quattuor milia deditorum
inermium civium in Circo interfici iussit. Quis autem illos potest
computare, quos in urbe passim, quisquis voluit, occidit, donec
admoneret Fufidius quidam vivere aliquos debere, ut essent, quibus
imperaret. Novo et inaudito exemplo tabulam proscriptionis proposuit,
qua nomina eorum, qui occidendi essent, continebantur; cumque omnium
orta esset indignatio, postridie plura etiam adiecit nomina. Ingens
caesorum fuit multitudo. Nec solum in eos saevivit, qui armis contra se
dimicavissent, sed etiam quieti animi cives propter pecuniae
magnitudinem proscriptorum numero adiecit. Civis quidam innoxius, cui
fundus in agro Albano erat, cum legens proscriptorum nomina se quoque
videret ascriptum, “Vae” inquit “misero mihi! me fundus Albanus
persequitur.” Neque longe progressus a quodam, qui eum agnoverat,
confossus est.

Depulsis prostratisque inimicorum partibus Sulla Felicem se edicto
appellavit, cumque eius uxor geminos eodem tunc partu edidisset, puerum
Faustum puellamque Faustam nominari voluit. Sed paucis annis post
repente contra omnium exspectationem dictaturam deposuit. Dimissis
lictoribus diu in Foro cum amicis deambulavit. Stupebat populus eum
privatum videns, cuius modo tam formidolosa fuerat potestas; quodque non
minus mirandum fuit, privato ei non solum salus, sed etiam dignitas
constitit, qui cives innumeros occiderat. Unus adulescens fuit, qui
auderet queri et recedentem usque ad fores domus maledictis incessere.
Atque ille, cuius iram potentissimi viri maximaeque civitates nec
effugere nec placare potuerant, unius adulescentuli contumelias patienti
animo tulit, id tantum in limine iam dicens: “Hic adulescens efficiet ne
quis posthac tale imperium deponat.”

Sulla deinde in villam profectus rusticari et venando vitam agere
coepit. Ibi morbo correptus interiit, vir ingentis animi, cupidus
voluptatum, sed gloriae cupidior; litteris Graecis atque Latinis
eruditus et virorum litteratorum adeo amans, ut sedulitatem etiam mali
cuiusdam poetae aliquo praemio dignam duxerit: nam cum ille epigramma in
eum fecisset eique subiecisset, Sulla statim praemium ei dari iussit,
sed ea lege, ne quid postea scriberet. Ante victoriam laudandus, in iis
vero, quae secuta sunt, numquam satis vituperandus, urbem enim et
Italiam civilis sanguinis fluminibus inundavit. Non solum in vivos
saeviit, sed ne mortuis quidem pepercit: nam Gai Marii, cuius, etsi
postea hostis, aliquando tamen quaestor fuerat, erutos cineres in flumen
proiecit. Qua crudelitate rerum praeclare gestarum gloriam corrupit.

    75.13: Sulla’s dictatorship differed widely from those of former

#XXV. Lucius Lucullus# [[stripped text]]

Lucius Lucullus ingeniō, doctrina, virtute fuit insignis. In Asiam
quaestor profectus ibi per multos annos admirabili quadam laude
provinciae praefuit, deinde absens factus aedilis, continuo praetor,
inde ad consulatum promotus est, quem ita gessit, ut omnes diligentiam
admirarentur, ingenium agnoscerent. Post ad Mithridaticum bellum missus
a senatu non modo opinionem vicit omnium, sed etiam gloriam superiorum
ducum. Idque eo fuit mirabilius, quod ab eo laus imperatoria non admodum
exspectabatur, qui adulescentiam in forensi opera, quaesturae diuturnum
tempus in Asiae pace consumpserat; sed incredibilis quaedam ingenii
magnitudo non desideravit usus disciplinam. Itaque cum totum iter et
navigationem consumpsisset partim in percontando a peritis, partim in
rebus gestis legendis, in Asiam factus imperator venit, cum esset Roma
profectus rei militaris rudis.

Lucullus eo bello magnas ac memorabiles res gessit; Mithridatem saepe
multis locis fudit; Tigranem, regum maximum, in Armenia vicit,
ultimamque bello manum magis noluit imponere, quam non potuit; sed
alioqui per omnia laudabilis et bello paene invictus pecuniae cupidini
nimium deditus fuit; quam tamen ideo expetebat, ut per luxuriam
effunderet. Itaque postquam de Mithridate triumphavit, abiecta omnium
rerum cura coepit delicate ac molliter vivere otioque et luxu diffluere:
magnifice et immenso sumptu villas aedificavit atque ad eorum usum mare
ipsum vexavit. Nam in quibusdam locis moles mari iniecit; in aliis,
suffossis montibus, mare in terras induxit, unde eum haud infacete
Pompeius Xerxem togatum vocare adsueverat.

Habebat Lucullus villam prospectu et ambulatione pulcherrimam. Quo cum
venisset Pompeius, id unum reprehendit, quod ea habitatio esset quidem
aestate peramoena, sed hieme minus commoda videretur; cui Lucullus
“Putasne” inquit “me minus sapere quam hirundines, quae adveniente hieme
sedem commutant?” Villarum magnificentiae respondebat epularum sumptus.
Cum aliquando modica ei, utpote soli, cena esset posita, coquum graviter
obiurgavit, eique excusanti ac dicenti se non debuisse lautum parare
convivium, quod nemo esset ad cenam invitatus, “Quid ais?” inquit iratus
Lucullus. “Nesciebasne Lucullum hodie cenaturum esse apud Lucullum?”

Laudanda est Luculli impensa et studium in libris. Nam et multos et
optimos conquisivit eosque liberaliter dedit utendos. Patebat omnibus
bibliotheca, et in porticus ei adiectas velut ad Musarum aedem veniebant
maxime Graeci tempusque ibi iucunde inter se traducebant ab aliis curis
liberi. Saepe cum iis versabatur Lucullus et inter magnam doctorum
virorum turbam ambulabat.

#XXVI. Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus# [[stripped text]]

Gnaeus Pompeius, stirpis senatoriae, bello civili se et patrem consilio
servavit. Cum enim Pompei pater exercitui suo ob avaritiam esset
invisus, facta in eum conspiratione, Terentius quidam, Gnaei Pompei
filii contubernalis, hunc occidendum suscepit, dum alii tabernaculum
patris incenderent. Quae res cum iuveni Pompeio cenanti nuntiata esset,
nihil periculo motus solito hilarius bibit et cum Terentio eadem, qua
antea, comitate usus est. Deinde cubiculum ingressus clam subduxit se
tentorio et firmam patri circumdedit custodiam. Terentius tum destricto
ense ad lectum Pompei accessit multisque ictibus stragula percussit.
Orta mox seditione Pompeius se in media coniecit agmina, militesque
tumultuantes precibus et lacrimis placavit ac duci reconciliavit.

Eodem bello Pompeius partes Sullae secutus ita se gessit ut ab eo maxime
diligeretur. Annos tres et viginti natus, ut Sullae auxilio veniret,
paterni exercitus reliquias conlegit, statimque dux peritus exstitit.
Magnus illius apud militem amor, magna apud omnes admiratio fuit; nullus
ei labor taedio, nulla defatigatio molestiae erat. Cibi vinique
temperans, somni parcus; inter milites corpus exercens cum alacribus
saltu, cum velocibus cursu, cum validis luctando certabat. Tum ad Sullam
iter intendit et in eo itinere tres hostium exercitus aut fudit aut sibi
adiunxit. Quem ubi Sulla ad se accedere audivit egregiamque sub signis
iuventutem aspexit, desiliit ex equo Pompeiumque salutavit imperatorem
et postea ei venienti solebat sella adsurgere et caput aperire et equo
descendere, quem honorem nemini nisi Pompeio tribuebat.

Postea Pompeius in Siciliam profectus est, ut eam a Carbone, Sullae
inimico, occupatam reciperet. Carbo comprehensus et ad Pompeium ductus
est: quem Pompeius, etsi Carbo muliebriter mortem extimescens demisse et
flebiliter mortem deprecabatur, ad supplicium duci iussit. Longe
moderatior fuit Pompeius erga Sthenium, Siciliae cuiusdam civitatis
principem. Cum enim in eam civitatem animadvertere decrevisset, quae
sibi adversata fuisset, inique eum facturum Sthenius exclamavit, si ob
unius culpam omnes puniret. Interroganti Pompeio quisnam ille unus
esset, “Ego” inquit Sthenius “qui cives meos ad id induxi.” Tam libera
voce delectatus Pompeius omnibus et Sthenio ipsi pepercit.

Transgressus inde in Africam Iarbam, Numidiae regem, qui Marii partibus
favebat, bello persecutus intra dies quadraginta oppressit et Africam
subegit adulescens quattuor et viginti annorum. Deinde cum litterae ei a
Sulla redditae essent, quibus exercitu dimisso cum una legione
successorem exspectare iubebatur, Pompeius, quamquam aegre id ferebat,
tamen paruit et Romam revertit. Revertenti incredibilis hominum
multitudo obviam ivit; Sulla quoque laetus eum excepit et Magni
cognomine consalutavit. Nihilo minus Pompeio triumphum petenti restitit:
neque vero ea re a proposito deterritus est Pompeius aususque dicere
plures adorare solem orientem quam occidentem: quo dicto innuebat Sullae
potentiam minui, suam crescere. Ea voce audita Sulla, confidentia
adulescentis perculsus, “Triumphet! triumphet!” exclamavit.

Metello iam seni et bellum in Hispania segnius gerenti conlega datus
Pompeius adversus Sertorium vario eventu dimicavit. Maximum ibi in
proelio quodam periculum subiit: cum enim vir vasta corporis magnitudine
impetum in eum fecisset, Pompeius manum amputavit; sed multis in eum
concurrentibus vulnus in femore accepit et a suis fugientibus desertus
in hostium potestate erat. At praeter spem evasit: barbari enim equum
eius auro phalerisque eximiis instructum ceperant. Dum igitur praedam
inter se altercantes partiuntur, Pompeius eorum manus effugit. Altero
proelio cum Metellus Pompeio laboranti auxilio venisset, Sertorius
recedere coactus dixisse fertur: “Nisi anus illa supervenisset, ego hunc
puerum verberibus castigatum Romam dimisissem.” Metellum anum
appellabat, quia is, iam senex, ad mollem et effeminatam vitam
deflexerat. Sertorio interfecto Pompeius Hispaniam recepit.

Cum piratae illa tempestate maria omnia infestarent et quasdam etiam
Italiae urbes diripuissent, ad eos opprimendos cum imperio
extraordinario missus est Pompeius. Nimiae viri potentiae obsistebant
quidam ex optimatibus et imprimis Quintus Catulus. Qui cum in contione
dixisset esse quidem praeclarum virum Cn. Pompeium, sed non esse uni
omnia tribuenda, adiecissetque: “Si quid huic acciderit, quem in eius
locum substituetis?” summo consensu succlamavit universa contio, “Te,
Quinte Catule.” Tam honorifico civium testimonio victus Catulus e
contione discessit. Pompeius, dispositis per omnes maris recessus
navibus, brevi terrarum orbem illa peste liberavit; praedones multis
locis victos fudit; eosdem in deditionem acceptos in urbibus et agris
procul a mari conlocavit. Nihil hac victoria celerius, nam intra
quadragesimum diem piratas toto mari expulit.

Confecto bello piratico, Gnaeus Pompeius contra Mithridatem profectus in
Asiam magna celeritate contendit. Proelium cum rege conserere cupiebat,
neque opportuna dabatur pugnandi facultas, quia Mithridates interdiu
castris se continebat, noctu vero haud tutum erat congredi cum hoste in
locis ignotis. Nocte tamen aliquando cum Pompeius Mithridatem aggressus
esset, luna magno fuit Romanis adiumento. Quam cum Romani a tergo
haberent, umbrae corporum longius proiectae ad primos usque hostium
ordines pertinebant, unde decepti regii milites in umbras, tamquam in
propinquum hostem, tela mittebant. Victus Mithridates in Pontum
profugit. Pharnaces filius bellum ei intulit, qui, occisis a patre
fratribus, vitae suae ipse timebat. Mithridates a filio obsessus venenum
sumpsit; quod cum tardius subiret, quia adversus venena multis antea
medicamentis corpus firmaverat, a milite Gallo, a quo ut adiuvaret se
petierat, interfectus est.

Tigrani deinde, Armeniae regi, qui Mithridatis partes secutus erat,
Pompeius bellum intulit eumque ad deditionem compulit. Qui cum
procubuisset ad genua Pompei, eum erexit, et benignis verbis recreatum
diadema, quod abiecerat, capiti reponere iussit, aeque pulchrum esse
iudicans et vincere reges et facere. Inde in Iudaeam profectus Romanorum
primus Iudaeos domuit, Hierosolyma, caput gentis, cepit, templumque iure
victoriae ingressus est. Rebus Asiae compositis, in Italiam versus ad
urbem venit, non, ut plerique timuerant, armatus, sed dimisso exercitu,
et tertium triumphum biduo duxit. Insignis fuit multis novis
inusitatisque ornamentis hic triumphus; sed nihil inlustrius visum, quam
quod tribus triumphis tres orbis partes devictae causam praebuerant:
Pompeius enim, quod antea contigerat nemini, primum ex Africa, iterum ex
Europa, tertio ex Asia triumphavit, felix opinione hominum futurus, si,
quem gloriae, eundem vitae finem habuisset neque adversam fortunam esset
expertus iam senex.

Posteriore enim tempore orta inter Pompeium et Caesarem gravi
dissensione, quod hic superiorem, ille parem ferre non posset, bellum
civile exarsit. Caesar infesto exercitu in Italiam venit. Pompeius,
relicta urbe ac deinde Italia ipsa, Thessaliam petit et cum eo consules
senatusque omnis: quem insecutus Caesar apud Pharsalum acie fudit.
Victus Pompeius ad Ptolemaeum, Aegypti regem, cui tutor a senatu datus
erat, profugit, qui Pompeium interfici iussit. Latus Pompei sub oculis
uxoris et liberorum mucrone confossum est, caput praecisum, truncus in
Nilum coniectus. Deinde caput cum anulo ad Caesarem delatum est, qui eo
viso lacrimas non continens illud multis pretiosissimisque odoribus
cremandum curavit.

Is fuit Pompei post tres consulatus et totidem triumphos vitae exitus.
Erant in Pompeio multae et magnae virtutes ac praecipue admiranda
frugalitas. Cum ei aegrotanti praecepisset medicus ut turdum ederet,
negarent autem servi eam avem usquam aestivo tempore posse reperiri,
nisi apud Lucullum, qui turdos domi saginaret, vetuit Pompeius turdum
inde peti, medicoque dixit: “Ergo, nisi Lucullus perditus deliciis
esset, non viveret Pompeius?” Aliam avem, quae parabilis esset, sibi
iussit apponi.

Viris doctis magnum honorem habebat Pompeius. Ex Syria decedens,
confecto bello Mithridatico, cum Rhodum venisset, Posidonium cupiit
audire; sed cum audivisset eum graviter esse aegrum, quod vehementer
eius artus laborarent, voluit tamen nobilissimum philosophum visere. Mos
erat ut, consule aedes aliquas ingressuro, lictor fores percuteret,
admonens consulem adesse, at Pompeius fores Posidonii percuti honoris
causa vetuit. Quem ut vidit et salutavit, moleste se dixit ferre, quod
eum non posset audire. At ille “Tu vero” inquit “potes, nec committam ut
dolor corporis efficiat ut frustra tantus vir ad me venerit.” Itaque
cubans graviter et copiose de hoc ipso disputavit: nihil esse bonum nisi
quod honestum esset, nihil malum dici posse, quod turpe non esset. Cum
vero dolores acriter eum pungerent, saepe “Nihil agis,” inquit “dolor!
quamvis sis molestus, numquam te esse malum confitebor.”

  Gnaeus Pompēius,[3] stirpis senātōriae, bellō[4]

  Pompēī pater exercituī suō ob avāritiam esset
  invīsus, factā in eum cōnspīrātiōne, Terentius
  quīdam, Gnaeī Pompēī fīliī[5] contubernālis, hunc[6]               {5}
  occīdendum suscēpit, dum[7] aliī tabernāculum
  patris incenderent.[7] Quae rēs cum iuvenī Pompēiō
  cēnantī nūntiāta esset, nihil perīculō mōtus
  solitō[8] hilarius bibit et cum Terentiō eādem,
  quā[9] anteā, cōmitāte ūsus est. Deinde cubiculum ingressus clam  {10}
  subdūxit sē tentōriō et fīrmam patrī circumdedit cūstōdiam.
  Terentius tum dēstrictō ēnse ad lectum Pompēī accessit multīsque
  īctibus strāgula percussit.[10] Ortā mox sēditiōne Pompēius sē in
    [[81]]
  media coniēcit āgmina, mīlitēsque tumultuantēs precibus et lacrimīs
  plācāvit ac ducī reconciliāvit.                                   {15}

  Eōdem bellō Pompēius partēs Sullae secūtus ita sē gessit ut ab
  eō māximē dīligerētur. Annōs trēs et vīgintī nātus, ut Sullae
  auxiliō venīret, paternī exercitūs reliquiās conlēgit, statimque
  dux perītus exstitit.[1] Māgnus illīus apud mīlitem amor, māgna
  apud omnēs admīrātiō fuit; nūllus eī[2] labor taediō,[2] nūlla
      dēfatīgātiō                                                   {20}
  molestiae[2] erat. Cibī[3] vīnīque[3] temperāns, somnī parcus[4];
  inter mīlitēs corpus exercēns cum alacribus saltū,[5] cum vēlōcibus
  cursū,[5] cum validīs luctandō[5] certābat. Tum ad Sullam iter
  intendit et in eō itinere trēs hostium exercitūs aut fūdit aut sibi
  adiūnxit. Quem ubi Sulla ad sē accēdere audīvit ēgregiamque       {25}
  sub sīgnīs iuventūtem āspexit, dēsiliit ex equō Pompēiumque
  salūtāvit imperātōrem et posteā eī[6] venientī solēbat sellā
  adsurgere et caput aperīre et equō dēscendere, quem honōrem nēminī
  nisi Pompēiō tribuēbat.

  Posteā Pompēius in Siciliam profectus est, ut eam ā Carbōne,      {30}
  Sullae inimīcō, occupātam reciperet. Carbō comprehēnsus et ad
  Pompēium ductus est: quem Pompēius, etsi Carbō[7] muliebriter
  mortem extimēscēns dēmissē et flēbiliter mortem dēprecābātur,
  ad supplicium dūcī iussit. Longē moderātior fuit Pompēius ergā
  Sthenium, Siciliae cūiusdam cīvitātis prīncipem. Cum enim in      {35}
  eam cīvitātem animadvertere dēcrēvisset, quae[8] sibi adversāta
  fuisset, inīquē eum factūrum Sthenius exclāmāvit,[9] sī ob ūnīus
  culpam omnēs pūnīret. Interrogantī Pompēiō quisnam ille ūnus
  esset, “Ego” inquit Sthenius “quī cīvēs meōs ad id indūxī.”
    [[82]]
  Tam līberā vōce dēlectātus Pompēius omnibus et Stheniō ipsī       {40}
  pepercit.[1]

  Trānsgressus inde in Āfricam Iarbam, Numidiae rēgem, quī
  Mariī partibus favēbat, bellō persecūtus intrā diēs quadrāgintā
  oppressit et Āfricam subēgit adulēscēns[2] quattuor et vīgintī
  annōrum. Deinde cum litterae eī ā Sullā redditae essent, quibus   {45}
  exercitū[3] dīmissō cum ūnā legiōne successōrem exspectāre
  iubēbātur, Pompēius, quamquam aegrē id ferēbat, tamen pāruit et
  Rōmam revertit. Revertentī incrēdibilis hominum multitūdō
  obviam īvit; Sulla quoque laetus eum excēpit et Māgnī
  cōgnōmine cōnsalūtāvit. Nihilō minus Pompēiō triumphum petentī    {50}

  aususque[4] dīcere plūrēs adōrāre sōlem orientem quam occidentem:
  quō dictō innuēbat Sullae potentiam minuī, suam crēscere.
  Eā vōce audītā Sulla, cōnfīdentiā adulēscentis perculsus,[5]
  “Triumphet! triumphet!” exclāmāvit.                               {55}

  Metellō[6] iam senī[7] et bellum in Hispāniā sēgnius gerentī
  conlēga datus Pompēius adversus Sertōrium variō ēventū dīmicāvit.
  Māximum ibi in proeliō quōdam perīculum subiit: cum enim vir
  vāstā corporis māgnitūdine impetum in eum fēcisset, Pompēius
  manum amputāvit; sed multīs[8] in eum concurrentibus vulnus in    {60}
  femore accēpit et ā suīs fugientibus dēsertus in[9] hostium potestāte

  phalerīsque eximiīs īnstrūctum cēperant. Dum igitur praedam

  Alterō proeliō cum Metellus Pompēiō labōrantī auxiliō vēnisset,   {65}

  Cōnfectō bellō pīrāticō, Gnaeus Pompēius contrā Mithridātem

    80.4: The reference is to the war between Marius and Sulla. See
    selections XXIV and XXV.
    80.5: Cf. _iuvenī_, l. 7. We should say ‘the younger.’ He was at
    this time but nineteen years of age.
    80.6: #hunc . . . suscēpit#: ‘undertook to kill him.’ How
    literally? For #occīdendum#, see p. 2, n. 18.
    80.7: #dum#, though meaning ‘while’ (cf. p. xx, G 2), takes the
    subjunctive here because of the informal indir. disc. Terenti
    said: _fīlium . . . suscipiam dum aliī incenditis_.
    80.8: #solitō hilarius#: ‘with (even) more gaiety than usual.’
    #solitō# is here a noun. Neuter adj. and part. are often so used.

    81.3: objective gen. (p. 14, n. 15) with the part. #temperāns#,
    which here = a simple adj. So #somnī# is obj. gen. with #parcus#.
    81.4: Sc. _erat_.
    81.5: abl. of specification.
    81.6: #eī venientī#: ‘(as a mark of respect) to him when
    approaching.’ #eī# is a dat. of advantage with #adsurgere#.
    81.7: After #quem#, whose antecedent is #Carbō#, l. 31, this word
    might have been omitted without loss of clearness. In fact, such
    omission is the more usual construction.
    81.8: #quae . . . fuisset#: causal. Note that in forming the
    pluperfect subjunctive certain writers often use _fuisset_ for
    _esset_.
    81.9: What were the exact words of Sthenius?
    82.1: _parcō_.
    82.2: ‘(being then) a young man.’ Cf. p. 44, n. 12.

    82.8: #multīs . . . concurrentibus#: the abl. abs. here denotes
    both time and cause; see p. xxiii, K 6. The prefix in

    ‘they wrangled about the division.’
    83.1: Why subjunctive?
    83.2: ‘_though_ already old.’ The thought is that luxury and
    effeminacy are especially unbecoming to old age.
    83.3: See p. xx, H 2. What is the meaning of the change of tense
    in #dīripuissent#?

    84.2: _obsideō_.
    84.3: #ā quō . . . petierat#: ‘whom he had asked to help him.’ How
    literally? #ut adiuvāret sē# is a substantive clause of purpose
    and object of _petierat_. See p. 7, n. 20.
    84.4: _ērigō_.
    84.5: #aequē . . . facere#: lit., ‘because he thought it an
    equally fine thing both to conquer kings and to create them.’ The
    expression is somewhat careless. We would say: ‘as glorious to
    create kings as to conquer them.’ #aequē pulchrum# is predicate,
    #et vincere . . . et facere# subject to #esse#.
    84.6: #prīmus . . . domuit#: cf. p. 38, n. 1.
    84.7: #iūre victōriae#: ‘by right of (i.e. on the strength of) his
    victory.’
    84.8: ‘turning’; lit., ‘having turned himself.’ Cf. n. on
    _cingitur_, XIII, l. 29.
    84.9: ‘the City,’ i.e. Rome.
    84.10: Cf. p. xvii, D 1.

    85.7: #autem# contrasts #negārent# with #praecēpisset#. There is a
    contrast also between #servī# and #medicus#.
    85.8: #Ergō . . . Pompēius#? The force of this sentence can be
    given only by a free rendering, thus: ‘Shall it be said, then,
    that Pompey would not be alive, had not Lucullus ruined himself by
    his luxury?’
    86.1: #Virīs . . . habēbat#: ‘he highly honored learned men.’
    86.2: _audiō_, like our ‘hear,’ is often used of listening to
    lectures or to teachers.

    a temporal abl. abs.
    86.5: Subjunctive in substantive clauses of result: see p. xix,
    F 3.
    86.6: infinitive, because the clause in which it stands is in
    apposition to #hōc#. This use of the infin. is common.
    86.7: #quamvīs sīs#: concessive subjunctive: H 586, II (515, III):

#XXVII. Gaius Iulius Caesar# [[stripped text]]

C. Iulius Caesar, nobilissima Iuliorum genitus familia, annum agens
sextum et decimum patrem amisit. Corneliam, Cinnae filiam, duxit uxorem;
cuius pater cum esset Sullae inimicissimus, is Caesarem voluit
compellere ut eam repudiaret; neque id potuit efficere. Qua re Caesar
bonis spoliatus cum etiam ad necem quaereretur, mutata veste nocte urbe
elapsus est et quamquam tunc quartanae morbo laborabat, prope per
singulas noctes latebras commutare cogebatur; et comprehensus a Sullae
liberto, ne ad Sullam perduceretur, vix data pecunia evasit. Postremo
per propinquos et adfines suos veniam impetravit. Satis constat Sullam,
cum deprecantibus amicissimis et ornatissimis viris aliquamdiu
denegasset atque illi pertinaciter contenderent, expugnatum tandem
proclamasse, vincerent, dummodo scirent eum, quem incolumem tanto opere
cuperent, aliquando optimatium partibus, quas secum simul defendissent,
exitio futurum; nam Caesari multos Marios inesse.

Stipendia prima in Asia fecit. In expugnatione Mitylenarum corona civica
donatus est. Mortuo Sulla, Rhodum secedere statuit, ut per otium
Apollonio Moloni, tunc clarissimo dicendi magistro, operam daret. Huc
dum traicit, a praedonibus captus est mansitque apud eos prope
quadraginta dies. Per omne autem illud spatium ita se gessit, ut piratis
pariter terrori venerationique esset. Comites interim servosque ad
expediendas pecunias, quibus redimeretur, dimisit. Viginti talenta
piratae postulaverant: ille quinquaginta daturum se spopondit. Quibus
numeratis cum expositus esset in litore, confestim Miletum, quae urbs
proxime aberat, properavit ibique contracta classe invectus in eum
locum, in quo ipsi praedones erant, partem classis fugavit, partem
mersit, aliquot naves cepit piratasque in potestatem redactos eo
supplicio, quod illis saepe minatus inter iocum erat, adfecit crucique
suffixit.

Quaestori ulterior Hispania obvenit. Quo profectus cum Alpes transiret
et ad conspectum pauperis cuiusdam vici comites per iocum inter se
disputarent num illic etiam esset ambitioni locus, serio dixit Caesar
malle se ibi primum esse, quam Romae secundum. Dominationis avidus
a prima aetate regnum concupiscebat semperque in ore habebat hos
Euripidis, Graeci poetae, versus:

  Nam si violandum est ius, regnandi gratia
  Violandum est. Aliis rebus pietatem colas.

Cumque Gades, quod est Hispaniae oppidum, venisset, animadversa apud
Herculis templum magni Alexandri imagine ingemuit et quasi pertaesus
ignaviam suam, quod nihildum a se memorabile actum esset in ea aetate,
qua iam Alexander orbem terrarum subegisset, missionem continuo
efflagitavit ad captandas quam primum maiorum rerum occasiones in urbe.

Aedilis praeter comitium ac Forum etiam Capitolium ornavit porticibus.
Venationes autem ludosque et cum conlega M. Bibulo et separatim edidit:
quo factum est ut communium quoque impensarum solus gratiam caperet. His
autem rebus patrimonium effudit tantumque conflavit aes alienum, ut ipse
diceret sibi opus esse millies sestertium, ut haberet nihil.

Consul deinde creatus cum M. Bibulo, societatem cum Gnaeo Pompeio et
Marco Crasso iunxit Caesar, ne quid ageretur in re publica, quod
displicuisset ulli ex tribus. Deinde legem tulit ut ager Campanus plebi
divideretur. Cui legi cum senatus repugnaret, rem ad populum detulit.
Bibulus conlega in Forum venit, ut legi obsisteret, sed tanta in eum
commota est seditio, ut in caput eius cophinus stercore plenus
effunderetur fascesque ei frangerentur atque adeo ipse armis Foro
expelleretur. Qua re cum Bibulus per reliquum anni tempus domo abditus
Curia abstineret, unus ex eo tempore Caesar omnia in re publica ad
arbitrium administrabat, ut nonnulli urbanorum, si quid testandi gratia
signarent, per iocum non, ut mos erat, ‘consulibus Caesare et
Bibulo’ actum scriberent, sed ‘Iulio et Caesare,’ unum consulem nomine
et cognomine pro duobus appellantes.

Functus consulatu Caesar Galliam provinciam accepit. Gessit autem novem
annis, quibus in imperio fuit, haec fere: Galliam in provinciae formam
redegit; Germanos, qui trans Rhenum incolunt, primus Romanorum ponte
fabricato aggressus maximis adfecit cladibus. Aggressus est Britannos,
ignotos antea, superatisque pecunias et obsides imperavit. Hic cum multa
Romanorum militum insignia narrantur, tum illud egregium ipsius
Caesaris, quod, nutante in fugam exercitu, rapto fugientis e manu scuto
in primam volitans aciem proelium restituit. Idem alio proelio legionis
aquiliferum ineundae fugae causa iam conversum faucibus comprehensum in
contrariam partem detraxit dextramque ad hostem tendens “Quorsum tu”
inquit “abis? Illic sunt, cum quibus dimicamus.” Qua adhortatione omnium
legionum trepidationem correxit vincique paratas vincere docuit.

Interfecto interea apud Parthos Crasso et defuncta Iulia, Caesaris
filia, quae, nupta Pompeio, generi socerique concordiam tenebat, statim
aemulatio erupit. Iam pridem Pompeio suspectae Caesaris opes et Caesari
Pompeiana dignitas gravis, nec hic ferebat parem, nec ille superiorem.
Itaque cum Caesar in Gallia detineretur, et, ne imperfecto bello
discederet, postulasset ut sibi liceret, quamvis absenti, alterum
consulatum petere, a senatu, suadentibus Pompeio eiusque amicis, negatum
ei est. Hanc iniuriam acceptam vindicaturus in Italiam rediit et
bellandum ratus cum exercitu Rubiconem flumen, qui provinciae eius finis
erat, transiit. Hoc ad flumen paulum constitisse fertur ac reputans
quantum moliretur, conversus ad proximos, “Etiamnunc” inquit “regredi
possumus; quod si ponticulum transierimus, omnia armis agenda erunt.”
Postremo autem “Iacta alea esto!” exclamans exercitum traici iussit
plurimisque urbibus occupatis Brundisium contendit, quo Pompeius
consulesque confugerant.

Qui cum inde in Epirum traiecissent, Caesar, eos secutus a Brundisio,
Dyrrachium inter oppositas classes gravissima hieme transmisit;
copiisque quas subsequi iusserat diutius cessantibus, cum ad eas
arcessendas frustra misisset, mirae audaciae facinus edidit. Morae enim
impatiens castris noctu egreditur, clam naviculam conscendit, obvoluto
capite, ne agnosceretur, et quamquam mare saeva tempestate intumescebat,
in altum tamen protinus dirigi navigium iubet et, gubernatore
trepidante, “Quid times?” inquit “Caesarem vehis!” neque prius
gubernatorem cedere adversae tempestati passus est, quam paene obrutus
esset fluctibus.

Deinde Caesar in Epirum profectus Pompeium Pharsalico proelio fudit, et
fugientem persecutus, ut occisum cognovit, Ptolemaeo regi, Pompeii
interfectori, a quo sibi quoque insidias tendi videret, bellum intulit;
quo victo in Pontum transiit Pharnacemque, Mithridatis filium,
rebellantem et multiplici successu praeferocem intra quintum ab adventu
diem, quattuor, quibus in conspectum venit, horis una profligavit acie,
more fulminis, quod uno eodemque momento venit, percussit, abscessit.
Nec vana de se praedicatio est Caesaris ante victum hostem esse quam
visum. Pontico postea triumpho trium verborum praetulit titulum: “Veni,
vidi, vici.” Deinde Scipionem et Iubam, Numidiae regem, reliquias
Pompeianarum partium in Africa refoventes, devicit.

Victorem Africani belli Gaium Caesarem gravius excepit Hispaniense, quod
Cn. Pompeius, Magni filius, adulescens fortissimus, ingens ac terribile
conflaverat, undique ad eum auxiliis paterni nominis magnitudinem
sequentium ex toto orbe confluentibus. Sua Caesarem in Hispaniam
comitata fortuna est: sed nullum umquam atrocius periculosiusque ab eo
initum proelium, adeo ut, plus quam dubio Marte, descenderet equo
consistensque ante recedentem suorum aciem increpans fortunam, quod se
in eum servasset exitum, denuntiaret militibus vestigio se non
recessurum; proinde viderent, quem et quo loco imperatorem deserturi
essent. Verecundia magis quam virtute acies restituta est. Cn. Pompeius
victus et interemptus est. Caesar, omnium victor, regressus in urbem
omnibus, qui contra se arma tulerant, ignovit et quinquies triumphavit.

Bellis civilibus confectis, conversus iam ad ordinandum rei publicae
statum fastos correxit annumque ad cursum solis accommodavit, ut
trecentorum sexaginta quinque dierum esset et, intercalario mense
sublato, unus dies quarto quoque anno intercalaretur. Ius laboriosissime
ac severissime dixit. Repetundarum convictos etiam ordine senatorio
movit. Peregrinarum mercium portoria instituit: legem praecipue
sumptuariam exercuit. De ornanda instruendaque urbe, item de tuendo
ampliandoque imperio plura ac maiora in dies destinabat: imprimis ius
civile ad certum modum redigere atque ex immensa legum copia optima
quaeque et necessaria in paucissimos conferre libros; bibliothecas
Graecas et Latinas, quas maximas posset, publicare; siccare Pomptinas
paludes: viam munire a Mari Supero per Apennini dorsum ad Tiberim usque:
Dacos, qui se in Pontum effuderant, coercere: mox Parthis bellum inferre
per Armeniam.

Haec et alia agentem et meditantem mors praevenit. Dictator enim in
perpetuum creatus agere insolentius coepit: senatum ad se venientem
sedens excepit et quendam, ut adsurgeret monentem, irato vultu respexit.
Cum Antonius, Caesaris in omnibus bellis comes et tunc consulatus
conlega, capiti eius in sella aurea sedentis pro rostris diadema,
insigne regium, imposuisset, id ita ab eo est repulsum, ut non offensus
videretur. Quare coniuratum in eum est a sexaginta amplius viris, Cassio
et Bruto ducibus conspirationis, decretumque eum Idibus Martiis in
senatu confodere.

Plurima indicia futuri periculi obtulerant dii immortales. Uxor
Calpurnia, territa nocturno visu, ut Idibus Martiis domi subsisteret
orabat et Spurinna haruspex praedixerat ut proximos dies triginta quasi
fatales caveret, quorum ultimus erat Idus Martiae. Hoc igitur die Caesar
Spurinnae “Ecquid scis” inquit “Idus Martias iam venisse?” et is “Ecquid
scis illas nondum praeterisse?” Atque cum Caesar eo die in senatum
venisset, adsidentem conspirati specie officii circumsteterunt ilicoque
unus, quasi aliquid rogaturus, propius accessit renuentique ab utroque
umero togam apprehendit. Deinde clamantem “Ista quidem vis est!” Casca,
unus e coniuratis, adversum vulnerat paulum infra iugulum. Caesar Cascae
bracchium adreptum graphio traiecit conatusque prosilire alio vulnere
tardatus est. Dein ut animadvertit undique se strictis pugionibus peti,
toga caput obvolvit et ita tribus et viginti plagis confossus est. Cum
Marcum Brutum, quem filii loco habebat in se inruentem vidisset, dixisse
fertur: “Tu quoque, mi fili!”

Illud inter omnes fere constitit talem ei mortem paene ex sententia
obtigisse. Nam et quondam cum apud Xenophontem legisset Cyrum ultima
valetudine mandasse quaedam de funere suo, aspernatus tam lentum mortis
genus subitam sibi celeremque optaverat, et pridie quam occideretur, in
sermone nato super cenam quisnam esset finis vitae commodissimus,
repentinum inopinatumque praetulerat. Percussorum autem neque triennio
quisquam amplius supervixit neque sua morte defunctus est. Damnati omnes
alius alio casu perierunt, pars naufragio, pars proelio; nonnulli semet
eodem illo pugione, quo Caesarem violaverant, interemerunt.

Quo rarior in regibus et principibus viris moderatio, hoc laudanda magis
est. C. Iulius Caesar victoria civili clementissime usus est; cum enim
scrinia deprehendisset epistularum ad Pompeium missarum ab iis, qui
videbantur aut in diversis aut in neutris fuisse partibus, legere
noluit, sed combussit, ne forte in multos gravius consulendi locum
darent. Cicero hanc laudem eximiam Caesari tribuit, quod nihil oblivisci
soleret nisi iniurias. Simultates omnes, occasione oblata, libens
deposuit. Ultro ac prior scripsit C. Calvo post famosa eius adversum se
epigrammata. Valerium Catullum, cuius versiculis famam suam laceratam
non ignorabat, adhibuit cenae. C. Memmii suffragator in petitione
consulatus fuit, etsi asperrimas fuisse eius in se orationes sciebat.

Fuisse traditur excelsa statura, ore paulo pleniore, nigris vegetisque
oculis, capite calvo; quam calvitii deformitatem, quod saepe
obtrectatorum iocis obnoxia erat, aegre ferebat. Ideo ex omnibus
decretis sibi a senatu populoque honoribus non alium aut recepit aut
usurpavit libentius quam ius laureae perpetuo gestandae. Vini
parcissimum eum fuisse ne inimici quidem negaverunt. Verbum Catonis est
unum ex omnibus Caesarem ad evertendam rem publicam sobrium accessisse.
Armorum et equitandi peritissimus, laboris ultra fidem patiens; in
agmine nonnumquam equo, saepius pedibus anteibat, capite detecto, seu
sol, seu imber erat. Longissimas vias incredibili celeritate
conficiebat, ut persaepe nuntios de se praeveniret: neque eum morabantur
flumina, quae vel nando vel innixus inflatis utribus traiciebat.

    89.7: = _Hōc tempore_, i.e. during this campaign. The language of
    this whole sentence is somewhat loose. The writer begins as if he
    were going to say: _Hīc, cum . . . nārrantur, tum Caesarem ipsum

    90.2: Sc. _erant_; also _erat_ with #gravis#. Through the
    influence of #iam prīdem# both verbs have the force of Eng.
    pluperfects: H 535, 1 (469, 2): M 738: A 277, _b_: G 234:
    B 260, 4.
    90.3: Point out the chiasmus (p. 21, n. 15) in #Caesaris . . .
    superiōrem#.
    90.4: The law required a candidate to give notice of his candidacy
    in person at Rome within seventeen days of the election. Caesar
    desired to stand for the consulship in 49 B.C.
    90.5: Cf. p. xviii, E 5.
    90.6: #bellandum# (sc. _esse_): an impersonal passive: ‘that war
    was necessary.’
    90.7: #quī . . . erat#: this river also formed the boundary
    between Italy proper and Cisalpine Gaul; hence by crossing it
    Caesar put himself in a position of open hostility to the
    government.
    90.8: = _per_, ‘through the midst of.’
    90.9: #cōpiīs . . . cēssantibus#: causal abl. abs.: ‘when, because
    his forces . . . tarried too long, he had sent,’ etc.
    91.1: Cf. p. xx, G 4.
    91.2: abl. both of cause and means. Join with #praeferōcem#.
    91.3: #intrā . . . vēnit#: ‘within four days of his arrival (and)
    within four hours after he caught sight of him.’
    91.4: See p. xvii, C 2.
    91.5: Strictly, we ought to have _ante victum esse quam vīsus
    esset_, the subjunctive being due to the indirect discourse.
    Caesar said: _ante victus est quam vīsus_ (_est_). The infinitive
    #vīsum# (_esse_) is due to attraction of the neighboring
    infinitive #victum esse#.
    91.6: #Ponticō . . . triumphō#: i.e. the procession in which he
    celebrated his victory in Pontus. #triumphō# is dat. with
    #praetulit#.
    91.7: Q. Metellus Pius Scipio, father-in-law of Pompey.
    91.8: at Thapsus, 46 B.C.
    91.9: Cf. XXVI, 49.
    91.10: #auxiliīs . . . cōnfluentibus#: the abl. abs. denotes both
    cause and attendant circumstance.
    91.11: = _eōrum quī sequēbantur_. Cf. _volentibus_, XIII, 97.
    92.1: ‘His own,’ i.e. his usual.
    92.2: #plūs . . . Mārte#: ‘since the battle was more than
    doubtful.’ The battle was fought at Munda, 45 B.C.
    92.3: Cf. p. 63, n. 5.
    92.4: = _quālem_. So #quō# = _quālī_.
    92.5: #fāstōs corrēxit#: In III, 22, it is stated that Numa
    divided the year into twelve months according to the course of the
    moon. This year contained only 355 days. In order, therefore, to
    make the months coincide with the seasons to which they belong,
    Numa ordered that every two years an extra month, called a _mēnsis
    intercalāris_, should be added. These intercalary months were
    inserted after February 23d, and contained alternately 22 and 23
    days. This arrangement made the average length of the year 366-1/4
    days. A further cause of confusion was the fact that the
    Pontifices, who had charge of the calendar, often, for political
    reasons, omitted the intercalary month. In Caesar’s time the error
    amounted to about three months. The calendar arranged by him is
    almost identical with that in use to-day.
    92.6: from _quisque_: ‘each,’ ‘every.’
    92.7: Sc. _rērum_. _rēs repetundae_ was a technical term for
    ‘extortion.’ For the gen., see p. 36, n. 8.
    92.8: A _lēx sumptuāria_ was a law regulating the sums of money
    which might be spent for various purposes. Caesar attempted
    especially to check extravagance in dress and at banquets.
    92.9: The infinitives in lines 146-151 are used because the
    clauses in which they stand are in apposition to _plūra ac
    māiōra_, l. 144. See p. 86, n. 5.
    93.1: #quās . . . pūblicāre#: ‘to throw open to the public as
    large libraries as possible.’
    93.2: The celebrated Mark Antony.
    93.3: #ā . . . virīs#: ‘by more than sixty men.’ For the case of
    #virīs#, see p. 10, n. 18.
    93.4: ‘had warned him,’ _not_ ‘had predicted’: hence it may be
    construed with a substantive clause of purpose (#ut . . .
    cavēret#) as its object.
    93.5: #speciē officiī#: ‘under pretense of doing him honor.’ Cf.
    _per speciem vēnandī_, XIX, 60.
    93.6: Sc. _eī_: dat. of interest.
    93.7: ‘by’; cf. p. 11, n. 10.
    93.8: #adversum# (sc. _eum_) #vulnerat#: ‘wounds him in front.’
    The wound was in the shoulder. For #adversum# as = an adverbial
    phrase, cf. p. 4, n. 4.
    94.1: ‘assailed.’
    94.2: _obtingō_.
    95.1: #suā morte#: ‘a natural death’; an ablative of manner.
    95.2: #Quō rārior . . . hōc laudanda magis#: ‘The rarer . . . the
    more praiseworthy.’ #Quō# and #hōc# are ablative of the degree of
    difference (a variety of the ablative of means): cf. p. 39, n. 12.
    95.3: i.e. over his fellow-citizens.
    95.4: #quī . . . partibus#: ‘who had apparently belonged,’ etc.
    How literally? With #dīversīs# sc. _Pompēiō_.
    95.5: #nē . . . darent#: ‘that they might not by any chance give
    occasion to vigorous measures,’ etc.
    95.6: #cūius . . . īgnōrābat#: ‘by whose verses, as he very well
    knew, his own fair fame had been wounded.’
    95.7: ablatives of characteristic.
    95.8: #paulō plēniōre#: ‘somewhat full.’
    95.9: Sc. _corōnae_, and cf. the frequent omission of _manus_ with
    _dextra_ and _sinistra_.
    96.1: #Vīnī parcissimum#: cf. _Cibī vīnīque temperāns, somnī
    parcus_, XXVI, 21, and note.
    96.2: #ut . . . praevenīret# expresses result, not purpose.]


#XXVIII. Marcus Tullius Cicero# [[stripped text]]

Marcus Tullius Cicero, equestri genere, Arpini, quod est Volscorum
oppidum, natus est. Ex eius avis unus verrucam in extremo naso sitam
habuit, ciceris grano similem; inde cognomen Ciceronis genti inditum.
Suadentibus quibusdam ut id nomen mutaret, “Dabo operam” inquit “ut
istud cognomen nobilissimorum nominum splendorem vincat.” Cum a patre
Romam missus, ubi celeberrimorum magistrorum scholis interesset, eas
artes disceret, quibus aetas puerilis ad humanitatem solet informari,
tanto successu tantaque cum praeceptorum tum ceterorum discipulorum
admiratione id fecit, ut, cum fama de Ciceronis ingenio et doctrina ad
alios manasset, non pauci, qui eius videndi et audiendi gratia scholas
adirent, reperti esse dicantur.

Cum nulla re magis ad summos in re publica honores viam muniri posse
intellegeret quam arte dicendi et eloquentia, toto animo in eius studium
incubuit, in quo quidem ita versatus est, ut non solum eos, qui in Foro
et iudiciis causas perorarent, studiose sectaretur, sed privatim quoque
diligentissime se exerceret. Primum eloquentiam et libertatem adversus
Sullanos ostendit. Nam cum Roscium quendam, parricidii accusatum, ob
Chrysogoni, Sullae liberti, qui in eius adversariis erat, potentiam nemo
defendere auderet, tanta eloquentiae vi eum defendit Cicero, ut iam tum
in arte dicendi nullus ei par esse videretur. Ex quo invidiam veritus
Athenas studiorum gratia petiit, ubi Antiochum philosophum studiose
audivit. Inde eloquentiae causa Rhodum se contulit, ubi Molonem, Graecum
rhetorem tum disertissimum, magistrum habuit. Qui cum Ciceronem dicentem
audivisset, flevisse dicitur, quod per hunc Graecia eloquentiae laude
privaretur.

Romam reversus quaestor Siciliam habuit. Nullius vero quaestura aut
gratior aut clarior fuit; cum magna tum esset annonae difficultas,
initio molestus erat Siculis, quos cogeret frumenta in urbem mittere;
postea vero, diligentiam et iustitiam et comitatem eius experti, maiores
quaestori suo honores quam ulli umquam praetori detulerunt. E Sicilia
reversus Romam in causis dicendis ita floruit, ut inter omnes causarum
patronos et esset et haberetur princeps.

Consul deinde factus L. Sergii Catilinae coniurationem singulari
virtute, constantia, cura compressit. Catilinae proavum, M. Sergium,
incredibili fortitudine fuisse Plinius refert. Stipendia is fecit
secundo bello Punico. Secundo stipendio dextram manum perdidit:
stipendiis duobus ter et vicies vulneratus est: ob id neutra manu,
neutro pede satis utilis, plurimisque postea stipendiis debilis miles
erat. Bis ab Hannibale captus, bis vinculorum eius profugus, viginti
mensibus nullo non die in catenis aut compedibus custoditus. Sinistra
manu sola quater pugnavit, duobus equis, insidente eo, suffossis.
Dextram sibi ferream fecit eaque religata proeliatus Cremonam obsidione
exemit, Placentiam tutatus est, duodena castra hostium in Gallia cepit.
Ceteri profecto, Plinius addit, victores hominum fuere, Sergius vicit
etiam fortunam.

Singularem huius viri gloriam foede dehonestavit pronepotis scelus. Hic
enim rei familiaris, quam profuderat, inopia multorumque scelerum
conscientia in furorem actus et dominandi cupiditate incensus
indignatusque, quod in petitione consulatus repulsam passus esset,
coniuratione facta senatum confodere, consules trucidare, urbem
incendere, diripere aerarium constituerat. Actum erat de pulcherrimo
imperio, nisi illa coniuratio in Ciceronem et Antonium consules
incidisset, quorum alter industria rem patefecit, alter manu oppressit.
Cum Cicero, habito senatu, in praesentem reum perorasset, Catilina,
incendium suum ruina se restincturum esse minitans, Roma profugit et ad
exercitum, quem paraverat, proficiscitur, signa inlaturus urbi. Sed
socii eius, qui in urbe remanserant, comprehensi in carcere necati sunt.
A. Fulvius, vir senatorii ordinis, filium, iuvenem et ingenio et forma
inter aequales nitentem, pravo consilio Catilinae amicitiam secutum
inque castra eius ruentem, ex medio itinere retractum supplicio mortis
adfecit, praefatus non se Catilinae illum adversus patriam, sed patriae
adversus Catilinam genuisse.

Neque eo magis ab incepto Catilina destitit, sed infestis signis Romam
petens Antonii exercitu opprimitur. Quam atrociter dimicatum sit exitus
docuit: nemo hostium bello superfuit; quem quisque in pugnando ceperat
locum, eum amissa anima tegebat. Catilina longe a suis inter hostium
cadavera repertus est: pulcherrima morte, si pro patria sic concidisset!
Senatus populusque Romanus Ciceronem patrem patriae appellavit. Cicero
ipse in oratione pro Sulla palam praedicat consilium patriae servandae
fuisse iniectum sibi a diis, cum Catilina coniurasset adversus eam.
“O dii immortales,” inquit “vos profecto incendistis tum animum meum
cupiditate conservandae patriae. Vos avocastis me a cogitationibus
omnibus ceteris et convertistis ad salutem unam patriae. Vos denique
praetulistis menti meae clarissimum lumen in tenebris tantis erroris et
inscientiae. Tribuam enim vobis, quae sunt vestra. Nec vero possum
tantum dare ingenio meo, ut dispexerim sponte mea in tempestate illa
turbulentissima rei publicae, quid esset optimum factu.”

Paucis post annis Ciceroni diem dixit Clodius tribunus plebis, quod
cives Romanos indicta causa necavisset. Senatus maestus, tamquam in
publico luctu, veste mutata pro eo deprecabatur. Cicero, cum posset
armis salutem suam defendere, maluit urbe cedere quam sua causa caedem
fieri. Proficiscentem omnes boni flentes prosecuti sunt. Dein Clodius
edictum proposuit ut Marco Tullio igni et aqua interdiceretur: illius
domum et villas incendit. Sed vis illa non diuturna fuit, mox enim totus
fere populus Romanus ingenti desiderio Ciceronis reditum flagitare
coepit et maximo omnium ordinum studio Cicero in patriam revocatus est.
Nihil per totam vitam Ciceroni itinere, quo in patriam rediit, accidit
iucundius. Obviam ei redeunti ab universis itum est: domus eius publica
pecunia restituta est.

Gravissimae illa tempestate inter Caesarem et Pompeium ortae sunt
inimicitiae, ut res nisi bello dirimi non posse videretur. Cicero quidem
summo studio enitebatur ut eos inter se reconciliaret et a belli civilis
calamitatibus deterreret, sed cum neutrum ad pacem ineundam permovere
posset, Pompeium secutus est. Sed victo Pompeio, a Caesare victore
veniam ultro accepit. Quo interfecto Octavianum, Caesaris heredem,
fovit, Antonium impugnavit effecitque ut a senatu hostis iudicaretur.

Sed Antonius, inita cum Octaviano societate, Ciceronem iam diu sibi
inimicum proscripsit. Qua re audita, Cicero transversis itineribus in
villam, quae a mari proxime aberat, fugit indeque navem conscendit, in
Macedoniam transiturus. Unde aliquotiens in altum provectum cum modo
venti adversi rettulissent, modo ipse iactationem maris pati non posset,
taedium tandem eum et fugae et vitae cepit regressusque ad villam
“Moriar” inquit “in patria saepe servata.” Satis constat, adventantibus
percussoribus, servos fortiter fideliterque paratos fuisse ad
dimicandum, ipsum deponi lecticam et quietos pati, quod sors iniqua
cogeret, iussisse. Prominenti ex lectica et immotam cervicem praebenti
caput praecisum est. Manus quoque abscissae; caput relatum est ad
Antonium eiusque iussu cum dextra manu in rostris positum.

Quamdiu res publica Romana per eos gerebatur, quibus se ipsa commiserat,
in eam curas cogitationesque fere omnes suas conferebat Cicero et plus
operae ponebat in agendo quam in scribendo. Cum autem dominatu unius
C. Iulii Caesaris omnia tenerentur, non se angoribus dedidit nec
indignis homine docto voluptatibus. Fugiens conspectum Fori urbisque
rura peragrabat abdebatque se, quantum licebat, et solus erat. Nihil
agere autem cum animus non posset, existimavit honestissime molestias
posse deponi, si se ad philosophiam rettulisset, cui adulescens multum
temporis tribuerat, et omne studium curamque convertit ad scribendum:
atque ut civibus etiam otiosus aliquid prodesse posset, elaboravit ut
doctiores fierent et sapientiores, pluraque brevi tempore, eversa re
publica, scripsit, quam multis annis ea stante scripserat. Sic facundiae
et Latinarum litterarum parens evasit paruitque virorum sapientium
praecepto, qui docent non solum ex malis eligere minima oportere, sed
etiam excerpere ex his ipsis, si quid insit boni.

Multa exstant facete ab eo dicta. Cum Lentulum, generum suum, exiguae
staturae hominem, vidisset longo gladio accinctum, “Quis” inquit
“generum meum ad gladium adligavit?”--Matrona quaedam iuniorem se, quam
erat, simulans dictitabat se triginta tantum annos habere; cui Cicero
“Verum est,” inquit “nam hoc viginti annos audio.”--Caesar, altero
consule mortuo die Decembris ultima, Caninium consulem hora septima in
reliquam diei partem renuntiaverat; quem cum plerique irent salutatum de
more, “Festinemus” inquit Cicero “priusquam abeat magistratu.” De eodem
Caninio scripsit Cicero: “Fuit mirifica vigilantia Caninius, qui toto
suo consulatu somnum non viderit.”

  Tulliō[8] īgnī et aquā interdīcerētur: illīus domum et vīllās
  incendit. Sed vīs illa nōn diuturna fuit, mox enim tōtus ferē populus
  Rōmānus ingentī dēsīderiō Cicerōnis reditum flāgitāre coepit et
  māximō omnium ōrdinum studiō Cicerō in patriam revocātus est.
    [[100]]
  Nihil per tōtam vītam Cicerōnī itinere, quō in patriam rediit,   {100}
  accidit iūcundius. Obviam[1] eī redeuntī ab ūniversīs itum est: domus
  ēius pūblicā pecūniā restitūta est.

  Gravissimae illā tempestāte inter Caesarem et Pompēium ortae
  sunt inimīcitiae, ut rēs[2] nisi bellō dīrimī nōn posse vidērētur.
  Cicerō quidem summō studiō ēnītēbātur[3] ut eōs inter sē reconciliāret
  et ā bellī cīvīlis calamitātibus dēterrēret, sed cum neutrum     {106}

  Sed victō Pompēiō, ā Caesare victōre veniam ultrō accēpit. Quō

  Sed Antōnius, initā cum Octāviānō societāte,[5] Cicerōnem iam

#XXIX. Marcus Brutus# [[stripped text]]

M. Brutus, ex illa gente, quae Roma Tarquinios eiecerat, oriundus,
Athenis philosophiam, Rhodi eloquentiam didicit. Eius pater, qui Sullae
partibus adversabatur, iussu Pompei interfectus erat, unde Brutus cum eo
graves gesserat simultates. Bello tamen civili Pompei causam, quod
iustior videretur, secutus dolorem suum rei publicae utilitati
posthabuit. Victo Pompeio Brutus a Caesare servatus est et praetor etiam
factus. Postea vero, cum Caesar superbia elatus senatum contemnere et
regnum adfectare coepisset, populus, praesenti statu haud laetus,
vindicem libertatis requirebat. Subscripsere quidam L. Bruti statuae:
“Utinam viveres!” Item ipsius Caesaris statuae: “Brutus, quia reges
eiecit, primus consul factus est; hic, quia consules eiecit, postremo
rex factus est.” Inscriptum quoque est M. Bruti praetoris tribunali:
“Dormis, Brute!”

Cognita populi Romani voluntate, Brutus adversus Caesarem conspiravit.
Pridie quam Caesar est occisus, Porcia, Bruti uxor, Catonis filia,
consilii conscia, egresso cubiculum Bruto, cultellum tonsorium quasi
unguium resecandorum causa poposcit eoque velut forte elapso se
vulneravit. Clamore deinde ancillarum in cubiculum revocatus obiurgare
eam coepit, quod tonsoris praeripuisset officium. Cui secreto Porcia
“Non est” inquit “hoc temerarium factum meum, sed in tali statu nostro
mei erga te amoris certissimum indicium. Experiri enim volui, si tibi
propositum ex sententia parum cessisset, quam aequo animo me ferro essem
interemptura.” Quibus verbis auditis Brutus ad caelum manus et oculos
sustulisse dicitur et exclamavisse: “Utinam dignus tali coniuge maritus
videri possem!”

Interfecto Caesare, cum Antonius vestem eius sanguinolentam ostentans
populum veluti furore quodam adversus coniuratos inflammasset, Brutus in
Macedoniam concessit ibique apud urbem Philippos adversus Antonium et
Octavianum dimicavit. Victus acie, cum in tumulum se nocte recepisset,
audita Cassii morte, ne in hostium manus veniret, uni ex comitibus latus
transfodiendum praebuit. Antonius Bruti corpus liberto suo sepeliendum
tradidit, quoque honoratius cremaretur, inici ei suum paludamentum
iussit, iacentem non hostem, sed civem deposito existimans odio. Cumque
interceptum a liberto paludamentum comperisset, ira percitus protinus
in eum animadvertit, praefatus: “Quid? tu ignorasti cuius tibi viri
sepulturam commisissem?” Non eadem fuit Octaviani erga Brutum moderatio,
is enim avulsum Bruti caput Romam misit, ut Gai Caesaris statuae
subiceretur. Porcia cum victum et interemptum virum suum cognovisset,
quia ferrum non dabatur, ardentes ore carbones hausit, virilem patris
exitum mulier imitata novo mortis genere.

#XXX. Octavianus Caesar Augustus# [[stripped text]]

Octavianus, Iuliae, Gai Caesaris sororis, nepos, quartum annum agens
patrem amisit. Ab avunculo adoptatus profectum eum in Hispanias adversus
Gnaei Pompei liberos secutus est. Deinde ab eo Apolloniam missus studiis
vacavit. Utque primum occisum Caesarem heredemque se comperit, in urbem
regressus hereditatem adiit, nomen Caesaris sumpsit conlectoque
veteranorum exercitu opem Decimo Bruto tulit, qui ab Antonio Mutinae
obsidebatur. Cum autem urbis aditu prohiberetur, ut Brutum de omnibus
rebus certiorem faceret, primo litteras misit plumbeis laminis
inscriptas, quas ad bracchium religatas urinatores Scultennam amnem
transnantes ad Brutum deferebant. Quin et avibus internuntiis utebatur.
Columbis enim, quas inclusas ante fame adfecerat, epistulas ad collum
religabat easque a proximo moenibus loco emittebat. Illae, lucis cibique
avidae, altissima aedificiorum petentes excipiebantur a Decimo Bruto,
qui eo modo de omnibus rebus certior fiebat, utique postquam disposito
quibusdam locis cibo columbas illuc devolare instituerat.

Bellum Mutinense Octavianus duobus proeliis confecit, quorum in altero
non ducis modo, sed militis etiam functus est officio atque in media
dimicatione, aquilifero legionis suae graviter saucio, aquilam umeris
subisse diuque fertur portasse. Postea reconciliata cum Antonio
gratiaiunctisque cum eo copiis, ut Gai Caesaris necem ulcisceretur, ad
urbem hostiliter accessit misitque qui nomine exercitus sibi consulatum
deposcerent. Cunctante senatu centurio, princeps legationis, reiecto
sagulo, ostendens gladii capulum non dubitavit in Curia dicere: “Hic
faciet, si vos non feceritis.”

Ita cum Octavianus vicesimo aetatis anno consulatum invasisset, pacem
fecit cum Antonio et Lepido, ita ut triumviri rei publicae constituendae
per quinquennium essent ipse et Lepidus et Antonius, et ut suos quisque
inimicos proscriberent. Quae proscriptio Sullana longe crudelior fuit.
Exstant autem ex ea multa vel extremae impietatis vel mirae fidei ac
constantiae exempla. T. Toranius, triumvirorum partes secutus,
proscripti patris sui, praetorii et ornati viri, latebras, aetatem
notasque corporis, quibus agnosci posset, centurionibus edidit, qui eum
persecuti sunt. Alius quidam cum proscriptum se cognovisset, ad clientem
suum confugit; sed filius eius per ipsa vestigia patris militibus ductis
occidendum eum in conspectu suo obiecit.

Cum C. Plotius Plancus a triumviris proscriptus in regione Salernitana
lateret, servi eius, comprehensi multumque ac diu torti, negabant se
scire ubi dominus esset. Non sustinuit deinde Plancus tam fideles tamque
boni exempli servos ulterius cruciari; sed processit in medium
iugulumque gladiis militum obiecit. Senatoris cuiusdam servus cum ad
dominum proscriptum occidendum milites advenisse cognosset, commutata
cum eo veste, permutato etiam anulo, illum postico clam emisit, se autem
in cubiculum ad lectulum recepit et ut dominum occidi passus est.
“Quanti viri est” addit Seneca, “cum praemia proditionis ingentia
ostendantur, praemium fidei mortem concupiscere!”

Octavianus deinde M. Brutum, interfectorem Caesaris, bello persecutus id
bellum, quamquam invalidus atque aeger, duplici proelio transegit;
quorum priore castris exutus vix fuga evasit. Victor acerbissime se
gessit: in nobilissimum quemque captivum non sine verborum contumelia
saeviit. Uni suppliciter sepulturam precanti respondisse dicitur iam
istam in volucrum fore potestate. Alios, patrem et filium, pro vita
rogantes sortiri fertur iussisse ut alterutri concederetur, ac cum,
patre quia se obtulerat occiso, filius quoque voluntaria occubuisset
nece, spectasse utrumque morientem. Orare veniam vel excusare se
conantibus, una voce occurrebat moriendum esse. Scribunt quidam
trecentos ex dediticiis electos ad aram divo Iulio exstructam Idibus
Martiis hostiarum more mactatos.

Abalienatus postea est ab Antonio, quod is, repudiata Octavia sorore,
Cleopatram, Aegypti reginam, duxisset uxorem: quae quidem mulier cum
Antonio luxu et deliciis certabat. Una se cena centies sestertium
absumpturam aliquando dixerat. Cupiebat discere Antonius, sed fieri
posse non arbitrabatur. Postero igitur die magnificam alias cenam, sed
cottidianam Antonio apposuit inridenti, quod promisso stare non
potuisset. At illa inferri mensam secundam iussit. Ex praecepto ministri
unum tantum vas ante eam posuere aceti, cuius asperitas visque
margaritas resolvit. Exspectante igitur Antonio quidnam esset actura,
margaritam, quam auribus gerebat, detraxit et aceto liquefactam
absorbuit. Victum Antonium omnes, qui aderant, pronuntiaverunt.

Octavianus cum Antonio apud Actium, qui locus est in Epiro, navali
proelio dimicavit. Victum et fugientem persecutus Aegyptum petiit, et
Alexandream, quo Antonius cum Cleopatra confugerat, obsedit. Antonius in
ultima rerum desperatione, cum habitu regis in solio regali sedisset,
mortem sibi ipse conscivit. Cleopatra, quam Octavianus, Alexandrea in
potestatem redacta, magno opere cupiebat vivam comprehendi triumphoque
servari, aspidem sibi adferendam curavit eiusque morsu periit.
Cleopatrae mortuae communem cum Antonio sepulturam tribuit.

Tandem Octavianus, hostibus victis solus imperio potitus, clementem se
exhibuit. Omnia deinceps in eo plena mansuetudinis et humanitatis.
Multis ignovit vel iis qui saepe graviter eum offenderant. Reversus in
Italiam triumphans Romam ingressus est. Tum bellis toto orbe compositis
Iani gemini portas sua manu clausit, quae bis tantum antea clausae
fuerant, primum sub Numa rege, iterum post primum Punicum bellum. Tunc
omnes praeteritorum malorum oblivio cepit populusque Romanus praesentis
otii laetitia perfruebatur. Octaviano maximi honores a senatu delati
sunt. Ipse Augustus cognominatus et in honorem eius mensis Sextilis
eodem nomine appellatus est, quod illo mense bellis civilibus finis
esset impositus. Patris patriae cognomen universi maximo consensu
detulerunt ei. Deferentibus lacrimans respondit Augustus his verbis:
“Compos factus votorum meorum, patres conscripti, quid habeo aliud, quod
deos immortales precer, quam ut hunc consensum vestrum ad ultimum vitae
finem mihi perferre liceat!”

Dictaturam magna vi offerente populo deprecatus est. Domini
appellationem semper exhorruit eamque sibi tribui edicto vetuit. Immo de
restituenda re publica non semel cogitavit, sed reputans et se privatum
non sine periculo fore, et rem publicam plurium arbitrio commissum iri,
summam retinuit potestatem, id vero studuit ne quem novi status
paeniteret. Bene de iis etiam, quos adversarios expertus erat, et
sentiebat et loquebatur. Legentem aliquando unum e nepotibus invenit;
cumque puer territus volumen Ciceronis, quod manu tenebat, veste
tegeret, Augustus librum cepit eoque statim reddito, “Hic vir,” inquit
“fili mi, doctus fuit et patriae amans.”

Pedibus saepe per urbem incedebat summaque comitate adeuntes excipiebat.
Convenit aliquando eum veteranus miles, qui vocatus in ius
periclitabatur rogavitque ut sibi adesset. Statim Augustus unum e
comitatu suo elegit advocatum, qui litigatorem commendaret. Tum
veteranus exclamavit: “At non ego, te periclitante bello Actiaco,
vicarium quaesivi, sed ipse pro te pugnavi,” simulque detexit
cicatrices. Erubuit Augustus atque ipse venit in advocationem.

Cum post Actiacam victoriam Octavianus Romam reverteretur, occurrit ei
inter gratulantes opifex quidam corvum tenens, quem instituerat haec
dicere: “Ave, Caesar, victor, imperator!” Miratus Caesar officiosam avem
viginti milibus nummorum emit. Socius opificis, ad quem nihil ex illa
liberalitate pervenerat, adfirmavit Caesari habere illum et alium
corvum, quem ut adferre cogeretur rogavit. Adlatus verba, quae
didicerat, expressit: “Ave, Antoni, victor, imperator!” Nihil
exasperatus Caesar satis duxit iubere illum dividere donativum cum
contubernali. Salutatus similiter a psittaco emi eum iussit.

Exemplum sutorem pauperem sollicitavit ut corvum institueret ad parem
salutationem. Qui impendio exhaustus saepe ad avem non respondentem
dicere solebat “Opera et impensa periit!” Aliquando tamen corvus coepit
dicere dictam salutationem. Hac audita, dum transit, Augustus respondit:
“Satis domi talium salutatorum habeo.” Superfuit corvo memoria, ut et
illa, quibus dominum querentem solebat audire, subtexeret: “Opera et
impensa periit.” Ad quod Caesar risit emique avem iussit, quanti nullam
ante emerat.

Solebat Graeculus quidam descendenti e palatio Caesari honorificum
aliquod epigramma porrigere. Id cum frustra saepe fecisset et tamen
rursus eum idem facturum duxisset Augustus, breve sua manu in charta
exaravit Graecum epigramma et Graeculo advenienti obviam misit. Ille
inter legendum laudare mirarique tam voce quam vultu gestuque. Deinde
cum accessisset ad sellam, qua Caesar vehebatur, demissa in pauperem
crumenam manu paucos denarios protulit, quos principi daret, dixitque se
plus daturum fuisse, si plus habuisset. Secuto omnium risu,
dispensatorem Caesar vocavit et satis grandem pecuniae summam numerari
Graeculo iussit.

Augustus fere nulli se invitanti negabat. Exceptus igitur a quodam cena
satis parca et paene cottidiana, hoc tantum insusurravit: “Non putabam
me tibi esse tam familiarem.” Cum aliquando apud Pollionem quendam
cenaret fregissetque unus e servis vas crystallinum, rapi eum ad mortem
Pollio iussit et obici muraenis quas ingens piscina continebat. Evasit e
manibus puer et ad pedes Caesaris confugit, nihil aliud petiturus quam
ut aliter periret nec esca piscium fieret. Motus est novo crudelitatis
genere Caesar et illum quidem mitti, crystallina autem omnia coram se
frangi iussit complerique piscinam.

Augustus in quadam villa aegrotans noctes inquietas agebat, rumpente
somnum eius crebro noctuae cantu. Qua molestia cum liberari se
vehementer cupere significasset, miles quidam, aucupii peritus, noctuam
prehendendam curavit, vivamque Augusto attulit, spe ingentis praemii.
Cui cum Augustus mille nummos dari iussisset, ille minus dignum praemium
existimans dicere ausus est: “Malo ut vivat,” et avem dimisit.
Imperatori nec ad irascendum causa deerat nec ad ulciscendum potestas:
hanc tamen iniuriam aequo animo tulit Augustus hominemque impunitum
abire passus est.

Augustus amicitias neque facile admisit et constantissime retinuit.
Imprimis familiarem habuit Maecenatem, equitem Romanum; qui ea, qua apud
principem valebat, gratia ita semper usus est, ut prodesset omnibus,
quibus posset, noceret nemini. Ius aliquando dicebat Augustus et multos
capite damnaturus videbatur. Aderat tum Maecenas, qui per circumstantium
turbam perrumpere et ad tribunal propius accedere conabatur. Quod cum
frustra tentasset, haec verba in tabella scripsit: “Surge tandem,
carnifex!” eamque tabellam ad Augustum proiecit. Qua lecta is statim
surrexit neque quisquam est morte multatus.

Habitavit Augustus in aedibus modicis, neque laxitate neque cultu
conspicuis, ac per annos amplius quadraginta in eodem cubiculo hieme et
aestate mansit. Suppellex quoque eius vix privatae elegantiae erat. Raro
veste alia usus est quam confecta ab uxore, sorore, filia neptibusque.
Item tamen Romam, quam pro maiestate imperii non satis ornatam
invenerat, adeo excoluit, ut iure gloriaretur marmoream se relinquere,
quam latericiam accepisset.

Forma fuit Augustus eximia et per omnes aetatis gradus venustissima.
Erat tamen omnis lenocinii neglegens et in capite comendo tam
incuriosus, ut eo ipso tempore, quo illud tonsoribus committeret, aut
legeret aliquid aut etiam scriberet.

Paucis annis antequam moreretur, gravissimam in Germania accepit cladem,
tribus legionibus cum duce Varo legatisque et auxiliis omnibus caesis.
Hac nuntiata excubias per urbem indixit, ne quis tumultus exsisteret, et
magnos ludos Iovi optimo maximo vovit, si res publica in meliorem statum
vertisset. Adeo denique consternatum ferunt, ut, per continuos menses
barba capilloque submisso, caput interdum foribus inlideret, vociferans:
“Quintili Vare, legiones redde!” diemque cladis quotannis maestum
habuerit ac lugubrem.

Tandem adflicta valetudine in Campaniam concessit, ubi, remisso ad otium
animo, nullo hilaritatis genere abstinuit. Supremo vitae die petito
speculo capillum sibi comi iussit et amicos circumstantes percontatus
ecquid iis videretur mimum vitae commode transegisse, adiecit solitam
clausulam: “Edite strepitum vosque omnes cum gaudio applaudite.” Obiit
Nolae sextum et septuagesimum annum agens.


  #XXX. Octāviānus Caesar Augustus# [[as printed]]

  Octāviānus, Iūliae, Gāī Caesaris sorōris, nepōs, quārtum annum
  agēns patrem āmīsit. Ab avunculō adoptātus profectum eum in
  Hispāniās[12] adversus Gnaeī Pompēī līberōs secūtus est. Deinde
  ab eō Apollōniam missus studiīs[13] vacāvit. Utque prīmum occīsum
    [[104]]
  Caesarem hērēdemque sē comperit, in urbem regressus                {5}
  hērēditātem adiit, nōmen Caesaris sūmpsit conlēctōque veterānōrum
  exercitū opem Decimō[1] Brūtō tulit, quī ab
  Antōniō Mutinae obsidēbātur. Cum autem
  urbis aditū prohibērētur, ut Brūtum dē omnibus
  rēbus certiōrem faceret, prīmō lītterās                           {10}
  mīsit plumbeīs[2] lāminīs īnscrīptās, quās ad
  bracchium[3] religātās ūrīnātōrēs[4] Scultennam
  amnem trānsnantēs[5] ad Brūtum dēferēbant.
  Quīn et avibus internūntiīs ūtēbātur. Columbīs[6]
  enim, quās inclūsās ante famē[7] adfēcerat,                       {15}
  epistulās ad collum religābat eāsque ā proximō moenibus locō
  ēmittēbat. Illae, lūcis cibīque avidae, altissima aedificiōrum
  petentēs excipiēbantur ā Decimō Brūtō, quī eō modō dē omnibus
  rēbus certior fīēbat, utique[8] postquam dispositō quibusdam locīs
  cibō columbās illūc dēvolāre īnstituerat.                         {20}

    [Illustration: YOUNG AUGUSTUS]

  Bellum Mutinēnse Octāviānus duōbus proeliīs cōnfēcit, quōrum
  in alterō nōn ducis modo, sed mīlitis etiam fūnctus est officiō
  atque in mediā dīmicātiōne, aquiliferō legiōnis suae graviter
  sauciō,[9] aquilam umerīs subīsse diūque fertur portāsse. Posteā
  reconciliātā cum Antōniō grātiā[10]iūnctīsque cum eō cōpiīs, ut   {25}
  Gāī Caesaris necem ulcīscerētur, ad urbem hostīliter accessit
  mīsitque quī nōmine exercitūs sibi cōnsulātum dēpōscerent.
  Cunctante senātū centuriō, prīnceps lēgātiōnis, rēiectō sagulō,[11]
  ostendēns gladiī capulum[12] nōn dubitāvit[13] in Cūriā dīcere: “Hīc
  faciet, sī vōs nōn fēceritis.”                                    {30}

  Ita cum Octāviānus vīcēsimō aetātis annō cōnsulātum invāsisset,
  pācem fēcit cum Antōniō et Lepidō, ita ut triumvirī reī
    [[105]]
  pūblicae cōnstituendae per quīnquennium essent ipse et Lepidus
  et Antōnius, et ut suōs quisque inimīcōs prōscrīberent. Quae
  prōscrīptiō Sullānā longē crūdēlior fuit. Exstant autem ex eā     {35}
  multa vel extrēmae impietātis vel mīrae fideī āc cōnstantiae
  exempla. T. Tōranius, triumvirōrum partēs secūtus, prōscrīptī
  patris suī, praetōriī et ōrnātī virī, latebrās, aetātem notāsque[1]
  corporis, quibus āgnōscī posset, centuriōnibus ēdidit, quī eum
  persecūtī sunt. Alius quīdam cum prōscrīptum sē cōgnōvisset,      {40}
  ad clientem suum cōnfūgit; sed fīlius ēius per ipsa vēstīgia
  patris mīlitibus ductīs occīdendum eum in cōnspectū suō obiēcit.

  Cum C. Plōtius Plancus ā triumvirīs prōscrīptus in regiōne
  Salernitānā[2] latēret, servī ēius, comprehēnsī multumque āc diū
  tortī,[3] negābant sē scīre ubi dominus esset. Nōn sustinuit deinde
  Plancus tam fidēlēs tamque bonī exemplī servōs ulterius cruciārī;
  sed prōcessit in medium iugulumque gladiīs mīlitum obiēcit.       {47}
  Senātōris cūiusdam servus cum ad dominum prōscrīptum occīdendum
  mīlitēs advēnisse cōgnōsset, commūtātā cum eō veste,
  permūtātō etiam ānulō, illum postīcō[4] clam ēmīsit, sē autem in  {50}
  cubiculum ad lectulum[5] recēpit et ut dominum occīdī passus est.
  “Quantī[6] virī est” addit Seneca,[7] “cum praemia prōditiōnis
  ingentia ostendantur, praemium fideī mortem concupīscere!”

  Octāviānus deinde M. Brūtum, interfectōrem Caesaris, bellō
  persecūtus id bellum, quamquam invalidus atque aeger, duplicī     {55}
  proeliō trānsēgit; quōrum priōre castrīs exūtus[8] vix fugā ēvāsit.
  Victor acerbissimē sē gessit: in nōbilissimum quemque captīvum
  nōn sine verbōrum contumēliā saeviit. Ūnī suppliciter sepultūram
  precantī respondisse dīcitur iam istam in volucrum fore
  potestāte. Aliōs, patrem et fīlium, prō vītā rogantēs sortīrī     {60}
  fertur iussisse ut alterutrī[9] concēderētur, ac cum, patre quia
    [[106]]
  sē obtulerat occīsō, fīlius quoque voluntāriā occubuisset nece,
  spectāsse utrumque morientem. Ōrāre veniam vel excūsāre sē
  cōnantibus, ūnā vōce occurrēbat[1] moriendum esse. Scrībunt
  quīdam trecentōs ex dēditīciīs[2] ēlēctōs ad āram dīvō[3] Iūliō   {65}
  exstrūctam Īdibus Mārtiīs hostiārum[4] mōre mactātōs.[5]

  Abaliēnātus posteā est ab Antōniō, quod is, repudiātā Octāviā
  sorōre, Cleopatram, Aegyptī rēgīnam, dūxisset uxōrem: quae quidem
  mulier cum Antōniō lūxū et dēliciīs[6] certābat. Ūnā sē cēnā
  centiēs[7] sēstertium absūmptūram aliquandō dīxerat. Cupiēbat     {70}
  dīscere Antōnius, sed fierī posse nōn arbitrābātur. Posterō igitur
  diē māgnificam[8] aliās cēnam, sed cottīdiānam Antōniō apposuit
  inrīdentī, quod prōmissō stāre nōn potuisset. At illa īnferrī
  mēnsam[9] secundam iussit. Ex praeceptō ministrī ūnum tantum      {74}
  vās ante eam posuēre acētī,[10] cūius asperitās vīsque margarītās[11]
  resolvit.[12] Exspectante igitur Antōniō quidnam esset āctūra,
  margarītam, quam auribus gerēbat, dētrāxit et acētō liquefactam
  absorbuit. Victum Antōnium omnēs, quī aderant, prōnūntiāvērunt.   {78}

  Octāviānus cum Antōniō apud Actium, quī locus est in Ēpīrō,       {80}
  nāvālī proeliō dīmicāvit. Victum et fugientem persecūtus Aegyptum
  petiit, et Alexandrēam, quō Antōnius cum Cleopatrā cōnfūgerat,
  obsēdit. Antōnius in ultimā rērum dēspērātiōne, cum
  habitū rēgis in soliō[13] rēgālī sēdisset, mortem sibi ipse cōnscīvit.
  Cleopatra, quam Octāviānus, Alexandrēā in potestātem redāctā,     {85}
  māgnō opere cupiēbat vīvam comprehendī triumphōque servārī,
  aspidem[14] sibi adferendam cūrāvit ēiusque morsū periit. Cleopatrae
  mortuae commūnem cum Antōniō sepultūram tribuit.

    [[107]]
  Tandem Octāviānus, hostibus victīs sōlus imperiō potītus,
  clēmentem sē exhibuit.[1] Omnia deinceps in eō plēna mānsuētūdinis[2]
  et hūmānitātis. Multīs īgnōvit vel iīs quī saepe graviter         {91}
  eum offenderant. Reversus in Ītaliam triumphāns Rōmam
  ingressus est. Tum bellīs tōtō orbe compositīs Iānī geminī portās
  suā manū clausit, quae bis tantum anteā clausae fuerant, prīmum
  sub Numā rēge, iterum post prīmum Pūnicum bellum. Tunc            {95}
  omnēs praeteritōrum malōrum oblīviō cēpit populusque Rōmānus
  praesentis ōtiī laetitiā perfruēbātur. Octāviānō māximī honōrēs
  ā senātū dēlātī sunt. Ipse Augustus cōgnōminātus et in honōrem
  ēius mēnsis Sextīlis[3] eōdem nōmine appellātus est, quod illō
  mēnse bellīs cīvīlibus fīnis esset impositus. Patris patriae     {100}
  cōgnōmen ūniversī māximō cōnsēnsū dētulērunt eī. Dēferentibus
  lacrimāns respondit Augustus hīs verbīs: “Compos[4] factus
  vōtōrum meōrum, patrēs conscrīptī, quid habeō aliud, quod deōs
  immortālēs precer, quam ut hunc cōnsēnsum vestrum ad ultimum
  vītae fīnem mihi perferre liceat!”                               {105}

  Dictātūram māgnā vī offerente populō dēprecātus est. Dominī
  appellātiōnem semper exhorruit eamque sibi tribuī ēdictō vetuit.
  Immō[5] dē restituendā rē pūblicā nōn semel cōgitāvit, sed
  reputāns et sē prīvātum nōn sine perīculō fore, et rem pūblicam
  plūrium arbitriō commissum[6] īrī, summam retinuit potestātem,   {110}
  id vērō studuit nē quem novī statūs paenitēret. Bene dē iīs
  etiam, quōs adversāriōs expertus erat, et sentiēbat et loquēbātur.
  Legentem aliquandō ūnum ē nepōtibus invēnit; cumque puer
  territus volūmen Cicerōnis, quod manū tenēbat, veste tegeret,
  Augustus librum cēpit eōque statim redditō, “Hīc vir,” inquit    {115}
  “fīlī mī, doctus fuit et patriae amāns.”

    [[108]]
  Pedibus saepe per urbem incēdēbat summāque cōmitāte adeuntēs
  excipiēbat. Convēnit[1] aliquandō eum veterānus mīles, quī
  vocātus in iūs perīclitābātur rogāvitque ut sibi adesset. Statim
  Augustus ūnum ē comitātū[2] suō ēlēgit advocātum, quī lītigātōrem
  commendāret. Tum veterānus exclāmāvit: “At nōn ego,              {121}
  tē perīclitante bellō Actiacō, vicārium[3] quaesīvī, sed ipse prō tē
  pūgnāvī,” simulque dētēxit cicātrīcēs.[4] Ērubuit[5] Augustus
  atque ipse vēnit in advocātiōnem.

  Cum post Actiacam victōriam Octāviānus Rōmam reverterētur,       {125}
  occurrit eī inter grātulantēs opifex[6] quīdam corvum[7] tenēns,
  quem īnstituerat haec dīcere: “Avē,[8] Caesar, victor, imperātor!”
  Mīrātus Caesar officiōsam avem vīgintī mīlibus nummōrum[9] ēmit.
  Socius opificis, ad quem nihil ex illā līberālitāte pervēnerat,
  adfīrmāvit Caesarī habēre illum et alium corvum, quem ut adferre
  cōgerētur rogāvit. Adlātus verba, quae didicerat, expressit:     {131}
  “Avē, Antōnī, victor, imperātor!” Nihil exasperātus Caesar
  satis dūxit iubēre illum dīvidere dōnātīvum[10] cum contubernālī.
  Salūtātus similiter ā psittacō[11] emī eum iussit.

  Exemplum sūtōrem[12] pauperem sollicitāvit ut corvum īnstitueret
  ad parem salūtātiōnem. Quī impendiō[13] exhaustus saepe ad       {136}
  avem nōn respondentem dīcere solēbat “Opera et impēnsa[13]
  periit[14]!” Aliquandō tamen corvus coepit dīcere dictam
  salūtātiōnem. Hāc audītā, dum trānsit, Augustus respondit: “Satis
  domī tālium salūtātōrum habeō.” Superfuit corvō memoria, ut      {140}
  et illa, quibus dominum querentem solēbat audīre, subtexeret[15]:
  “Opera et impēnsa periit.” Ad quod Caesar rīsit emīque avem
  iussit, quantī[16] nūllam ante ēmerat.

  Solēbat Graeculus quīdam dēscendentī ē palātiō Caesarī honōrificum
  aliquod epigramma porrigere.[17] Id cum frūstrā saepe fēcisset   {145}
    [[109]]
  et tamen rūrsus eum idem factūrum dūxisset Augustus, breve
  suā manū in chartā[1] exarāvit[2] Graecum epigramma et Graeculō
  advenientī obviam mīsit. Ille inter legendum laudāre[3] mīrārīque[3]
  tam[4] vōce quam[4] vultū gestūque. Deinde cum accessisset       {149}
  ad sellam, quā Caesar vehēbātur, dēmissā in pauperem crumēnam[5]
  manū paucōs dēnāriōs[6] prōtulit, quōs prīncipī daret, dīxitque
  sē plūs datūrum fuisse, sī plūs habuisset. Secūtō omnium
  rīsū, dispēnsātōrem[7] Caesar vocāvit et satis grandem pecūniae
  summam numerārī Graeculō iussit.

  Augustus ferē nūllī sē invītantī negābat. Exceptus igitur ā      {155}
  quōdam cēnā satis parcā et paene cottīdiānā, hōc tantum
  īnsusurrāvit[8]: “Nōn putābam mē tibi esse tam familiārem.” Cum
  aliquandō apud Pōlliōnem quendam cēnāret frēgissetque ūnus ē
  servīs vās crystallinum, rapī eum ad mortem Pōlliō iussit et     {159}
  obicī mūraenīs[9] quās ingēns piscīna[10] continēbat. Ēvāsit ē manibus
  puer et ad pedēs Caesaris cōnfūgit, nihil aliud petītūrus quam
  ut aliter perīret nec ēsca[11] piscium fieret. Mōtus est novō
      crūdēlitātis
  genere Caesar et illum quidem mittī,[12] crystallina autem
  omnia cōram sē frangī iussit complērīque piscīnam.

  Augustus in quādam vīllā aegrōtāns noctēs inquiētās agēbat,      {165}
  rumpente somnum ēius crēbrō noctuae[13] cantū. Quā molestiā cum
  līberārī sē vehementer cupere sīgnificāsset, mīles quīdam, aucupiī
  perītus, noctuam prehendendam cūrāvit, vīvamque Augustō attulit,
  spē ingentis praemiī. Cuī cum Augustus mīlle nummōs[14] darī     {169}
  iussisset, ille minus dīgnum praemium exīstimāns dīcere ausus est:
  “Mālō ut vīvat,” et avem dīmīsit. Imperātōrī nec ad īrāscendum
  causa deerat nec ad ulcīscendum potestās: hanc tamen iniūriam
  aequō animō tulit Augustus hominemque impūnītum abīre passus est.

    [[110]]
  Augustus amīcitiās neque facile admīsit et cōnstantissimē retinuit.
  Imprīmīs familiārem habuit Maecēnātem, equitem Rōmānum;          {175}
  quī eā, quā apud prīncipem valēbat, grātiā ita semper ūsus
  est, ut prōdesset omnibus, quibus posset, nocēret nēminī. Iūs
  aliquandō dīcēbat Augustus et multōs capite damnātūrus vidēbātur.
  Aderat tum Maecēnās, quī per
  circumstantium turbam perrumpere et                              {180}
  ad tribūnal propius accēdere cōnābātur.
  Quod cum frūstrā tentāsset, haec verba
  in tabellā scrīpsit: “Surge tandem,
  carnifex[1]!” eamque tabellam ad Augustum
  prōiēcit. Quā lēctā is statim surrēxit                           {185}
  neque quisquam est morte multātus.

    [Illustration: AUGUSTUS]

  Habitāvit Augustus in aedibus modicīs,
  neque laxitāte[2] neque cultū[3] cōnspicuīs,

Cannae, some young men of rank began to form plans for abandoning Italy.
4. Scipio hastened to their meeting-place, and, although[2] he was
alone, he forced them to give[3] up their conspiracy.[3] 5. After the
Romans had suffered two defeats in Spain, Scipio was chosen proconsul
and sent thither. 6. Here he prosecuted the war with such wisdom and
bravery that he earned the approval of all. 7. Do you not think that he
was worthy of the honor? 8. He gained possession of a large amount of
money and arms, but let the Spanish captives go without ransom. 9. He
did not doubt that in this way he would secure for the Romans the favor
of the Spanish [conciliate the Spanish to the Romans]. 10. Among the
captive Africans he found a boy of remarkable beauty,[4] who said that
his grandfather was the king of Numidia, and that he had crossed over
into Spain with his uncle Masinissa to carry on war with the Romans. 11.
Scipio freed the boy, and thus won the favor of the Numidian king. 12.
When the Spaniards wanted to call Scipio king, he asked them to refrain
from that title. 13. After Hannibal had been driven from Spain, Scipio,
who had[5] long been planning to transfer the war to Africa, sent
Laelius, whose[6] friendship he did not mistrust, to win over some of
the African chiefs. 14. Afterwards he crossed over to Africa himself,
and it is said that he met Hannibal [to him a meeting with Hannibal to
have been] at the court of Syphax. 15. It happened that many of those
chiefs were eager to form an alliance with Scipio. 16. His plan,
therefore, was easily carried out. 17. Although the young men of Sicily
shrank from so great a war themselves, still they were willing to
furnish horses and arms. 18. Although they were wealthy, they were not

determination that in a short time the Carthaginians recalled Hannibal
from Italy to defend his country. 20. A battle was fought [it was
fought] at Zama, a town five days’ march from Carthage. 21. The
Carthaginians were defeated, and forced to send ambassadors to sue for
peace. 22. As peace was now secured, Scipio returned to Italy. 23. On[7]
his arrival in Rome a vast multitude poured forth to meet him. 24.
Scipio was not only the most illustrious general of his age, but he was
also a man distinguished for [of distinguished] piety.[8] 25. The old
writers say that he used to visit [resort to] the capitol every day, to
consult with Jupiter about the public interests. 26. At Ephesus he[9]
afterwards had a conversation with Hannibal. 27. It is reported that
Hannibal acknowledged that Scipio was the greatest of all commanders.
28. When the senate seemed on the point[10] of transferring the conduct
of the war against Antiochus from Lucius Scipio to Laelius, because
(as was thought) the former[11] had too little courage and too little
wisdom for such a war, Africanus promised to be himself his brother’s
lieutenant. 29. Scipio could endure no dishonor to his family. 30. After
Antiochus had been defeated, when the senate demanded from Lucius Scipio
an accounting of the spoils, Africanus prevented it. 31. He said that he
had been of [for] so great aid to his country that his integrity ought

aid we obtained[13] so great a victory.” 34. As the whole assembly
followed him he was relieved from the insults of the tribunes. 35. Soon
afterward Scipio retired to the country and never returned to Rome.

1. Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, was the daughter of Scipio
Africanus. 2. She had been educated with such care herself that she was
able to train her sons wisely. 3. She told a Campanian woman, who was a
guest at her house, that she[1] too had some very beautiful jewels. 4.
Everybody knows that Cornelia’s jewels were her sons. 5. She has justly
been considered one of the wisest women of that age. 6. Though her sons
were most worthy of their excellent mother, yet the nobles thought that
they were disturbing the republic. 7. Both of the Gracchi thought more
of [preferred] their country’s safety than [to] their own lives. 8.
Tiberius tried to protect the common people, but the senate thought that
he was preparing for himself a way to regal power. 9. So Nasica urged[2]
all loyal citizens to follow him. 10. When Gracchus saw that the
senators were rushing upon him he fled, but was killed by a broken piece
of a bench. 11. Caius had the same[3] love for the common people as[3]
his brother. 12. All loyal citizens said that they opposed his plans
because they wanted the republic to be safe. 13. “If the law about
distributing grain to the common people is[4] passed,” said Piso,
“I shall come with the others to get the grain.” 14. Finally this was
decreed by the senate: “Let the consul see that the republic receive no
harm.” 15. Some say that Gracchus armed his household and took
possession of the Aventine. 16. When he was put to flight he ordered his
slave to kill him that he might not be arrested. 17. Such was the fate
of the Gracchi, the jewels of Cornelia, the best sons of the Roman
republic.

1. When Marius was in Spain with Scipio, some one asked this (question)
of Scipio. 2. If anything happens[1] to you, what equally great
commander will the republic have? 3. Scipio replied that Marius would be
a great commander. 4. In the war against Jugurtha it is said that he
made charges against Metellus so that he might be appointed commander
himself. 5. If you make me consul, I will shortly bring Jugurtha under
the power of the Romans. 6. Thus he persuaded the people to make[2] him
consul. 7. After Jugurtha had been conquered, he carried on war with the
Cimbri and Teutones. 8. His soldiers entreated Marius to lead them
against the enemy. 9. The battle was fought right at the foot of the
Alps. 10. As the Romans[3] had no water, Marius told his soldiers that,
if they conquered[4] the enemy, they would have abundance of water. 11.
It is said that after the battle the soldiers drank no less blood than
water, because the river was filled with the bodies of the slain. 12.
The Cimbri, having now entered Italy, sent messengers to Marius to ask
him to give them some land. 13. Marius threatened them[5] with the same
fate[5] which had befallen their brothers. 14. On the next day a battle
was fought, and slaughter terrible to witness[6] followed. 15. When the
women saw that they were defeated they strangled their babes and killed
themselves. 16. Marius envied the new consul, Sulla, because the war
against Mithridates had been assigned him. 17. When Sulla heard what
Marius had done, he returned to Rome with his army and drove him into
exile. 18. While Marius was hiding in a swamp, he was caught and thrown
into prison. 19. He asked the slave, who was sent to kill him, whether
he dared kill the great consul. 20. After Sulla had set out for Asia,
Marius, who was a few days’ journey from the city, returned and renewed
the civil war. 21. When he had put to death the best men of the state,
he gave over their homes to the rabble for plunder. 22. His death
afforded the Romans[7] more joy than his victory at Aquae Sextiae.

to King Tarquin? 3. Marius was vexed because Sulla had been chosen
quaestor. 4. Although Sulla had been dissolute, his military ability was
soon displayed. 5. He conquered Mithridates, the king of Pontus, and
would have completely subdued him had he not been recalled to Italy. 6.

advise him to spare some of his fellow-citizens. 8. If he had killed
all, there would have been none to govern [whom he should govern]. 9. He

and was well versed in Greek literature. 12. He once gave a reward to a
wretched poet who had dedicated a poem to him, on condition that he
should write nothing thereafter.

1. Lucullus was distinguished both in war and in peace. 2. It is stated
by certain writers that he spent all of his early life in law practice
and was untrained in the art[1] of war. 3. But in the war with
Mithridates he surpassed even[2] experts in this art.[1] 4. All say that
he was exceedingly fond of money. 5. And this is the more surprising for
the reason that he had been educated in Greek philosophy. 6. He was not
the only one of the Romans to[3] squander his money in building villas.
7. He used to dine with the greatest luxury even when he was alone. 8.
Though fond of banquets, he was no less fond of books, and had a great

The star prefixed to certain verbs, e.g. #flīgō# and #speciō#, indicates
that the verb was obsolete, i.e. not in ordinary use. Compound verbs are
defined under the simple verbs from which they are derived. To this
practice there are, however, two exceptions: (1) When neither the simple
verb nor any other compound formed from it occurs in the text, and
(2) in the case of certain verbs like #sūmō# and #surgō#, which, though
themselves compounds, came to be regarded virtually as simple verbs and
served as the base of further compounds.

The student will therefore save time and labor if he accustoms himself
when reading to analyze compound verbs before consulting the Vocabulary.
This analysis will often make plain the meaning of the compound, and
render it unnecessary to seek the aid of the Vocabulary at all.

Harkness’s New Latin Grammars

  Cloth-leather binding. 12mo, 464 pages    =$1.25=

=A SHORT LATIN GRAMMAR=

  Cloth-leather binding. 12mo, 254 pages    =.80=

  By ALBERT HARKNESS, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor Emeritus in
  Brown University.

These new text-books are the crowning triumph of a life-work which has
made the name of their author familiar to classical scholars and
teachers everywhere. They represent the latest advances in philological
science, and embody the results of the author’s large experience in
teaching and of his own linguistic studies, together with the
suggestions and advice of eminent German specialists in the field of
Historical and Comparative Grammar. The peculiar qualities of
simplicity, clearness, and adaptation of treatment to the practical
needs of the student and of the class room,--qualities that have always
characterized the Harkness Grammars,--have been preserved and even
intensified in these new books.

The Complete Latin Grammar is designed at once as a text-book for the
class room and a book of reference for the student. It aims not only to
present systematically for the benefit of the beginner the leading facts
and laws of the Latin language, but also to provide accurately for the
needs of the advanced student.

The Short Latin Grammar is published for the benefit of those who prefer
to begin with a more elementary manual, or those who do not contemplate
a collegiate course. In the preparation of this work the convenience and
interest of the student have been carefully consulted. The paradigms,
rules, and discussions have in general been introduced in the exact form
and language of the Complete Latin Grammar by which it may at any time
be supplemented. The numbering of the sections in the two books is also
alike.

LATIN PROSE WRITING

  =With Full Introductory Notes On Idiom=

  By MAURICE W. MATHER, Ph.D.
  Formerly Instructor in Latin in Harvard University

  and ARTHUR L. WHEELER, Ph.D.
  Instructor in Latin in Yale University

  =Half Leather, 12mo, 216 pages    Price $1.00=


The present book furnishes all the essential material for the writing of
average passages in Latin Prose. It is not intended to teach how to
write isolated sentences, illustrative of given constructions, but the
book assumes that the pupil, after a year or more of such practice, is
ready to learn the art of writing connected narrative in Latin. The
authors have based their exercises on Caesar’s Gallic War Books III and
IV, Nepos’s Alcibiades and Hannibal, and Cicero’s Manilian Law and
Archias, inasmuch as these are not only models of good style, but are
usually read in schools. As the book is not for beginners, the
individual exercises have not been made vehicles for teaching any one or
two constructions, but the authors have felt at liberty to introduce at
any time even the more difficult constructions; indirect discourse, for
instance, being taken up at the very beginning.

While, in general, the vocabulary and the constructions for any exercise
are supplied in the Latin text on which the given exercise is based, yet
enough variation from the language of the model is required to give the
pupil abundant practice in handling forms and constructions. By this
means the pupil’s power of observation is increased, his interest is
quickened by the pleasure of discovery, and he will remember the word
much better than if he found it ready at hand in a dictionary.

A number of recent examination papers from various colleges have been
inserted in the belief that they will be found useful for sight tests
and occasional examinations. The notes accompanying some of the papers
belong to the original examinations. At the end of the book are indexes
of words and constructions, and of English words and phrases with
references to sections of the Notes on Idiom in Part I.

PEARSON’S ESSENTIALS OF LATIN FOR BEGINNERS

  BY
  HENRY C. PEARSON
  Horace Mann School, Teachers’ College, Columbia University

  Cloth, 12mo, 320 Pages
  Price, 90 Cents


This book is designed to prepare pupils in a thorough fashion to read
Caesar’s Gallic War. It contains seventy lessons, including ten that are
devoted exclusively to reading, and six supplementary lessons. The first
seventy lessons contain the minimum of what a pupil should know before
he is ready to read Latin with any degree of intelligence and
satisfaction. The supplementary lessons deal largely with certain
principles of syntax that some teachers may not wish to present to their
pupils during the first year’s work. They are independent of one another
and of the rest of the book, and may therefore be taken up in any order
that the teacher wishes, or any number of them may be omitted.

The work contains many features and pedagogical improvements which will
commend themselves to teachers of first year Latin. Various
simplifications in statement are introduced, and throughout the greatest
care has been taken to preserve scientific accuracy while enunciating
principles in the simplest forms.

_Revised Edition_

VIRGIL’S AENEID

  With an Introduction, Notes, and Vocabulary by #HENRY S. FRIEZE#, late
  Professor of Latin in the University of Michigan. Revised by #WALTER
  DENNISON#, Professor of Latin in the University of Michigan.

  First Six Books       $1.30
  Complete      $1.50
  Complete Text Edition      $0.50

#This Work# differs in many respects from the former edition. Such
changes and alterations have been introduced as are necessary to make
the book conform to modern demands, and many important additions have
also been made.

#The Introduction# has been enlarged by the addition of sections on the
life and writings of Virgil, the plan of the Aeneid, the meter,
manuscripts, editions, and helpful books of reference.

#The Text# has been corrected to conform to the readings that have
become established, and the spellings are in accord with the evidence of
inscriptions of the first century A.D. To meet the need of early
assistance in reading the verse metrically, the long vowels in the first
two books are fully indicated.

#The Notes# have been thoroughly revised and largely added to. The old
grammar references are corrected and new ones (to Harkness’s Complete,
Lane & Morgan’s, and Bennett’s Grammars) added. The literary
appreciation of the poet is increased by parallel quotations from
English literature. The irregularities of scansion in each book are also
given with sufficient explanations.

#The Vocabulary# has been made as simple as possible and includes only
those words occurring in the Aeneid. The parts of compound words are not
indicated separately when they appear unmodified in the compound form.
The principal parts of verbs are given which are understood to be in
actual use.

#The Illustrations# for the most part are new and fresh, and have been
selected with great care with a view to assisting directly in the
interpretation of the text. There are also maps showing the wanderings
of Aeneas, the vicinity of Cumae, and pre-historic Rome, and a full-page
facsimile of one of the best manuscripts of Virgil, the Codex Palatinus.

#CICERO’S ORATIONS#

AND SELECTIONS FROM THE LETTERS

  Edited By

  WILLIAM R. HARPER, Ph.D., D.D., LL.D.
  President of the University of Chicago

  and

  FRANK A. GALLUP, A.M.
  Professor of Latin, Colgate Academy

  =Half Leather, 12mo, 566 pages, with Maps and Illustrations.
  Price, $1.30=


This edition of Cicero contains in addition to selected letters all the
orations required by all the colleges throughout the country. It is
intended to be distinctly practical and aims solely to meet the needs of
secondary and preparatory schools.

  =The Orations= have been arranged in the order in which it is
  thought they can be read to the best advantage and include, besides
  the four against Catiline, those for Archais, Milo, Marcellus, and
  Ligarius, Pompey’s Commission, and the Fourteenth Philippic.

  =The Letters= have been selected with special reference to their
  fitness for reading at sight and for this purpose they have no equal
  in Roman literature.

  =The Introduction= includes a well balanced life of Cicero with a
  just estimate of his standing and character and many helpful
  features which will give the student a comprehensive knowledge of
  Roman life and politics.

  =The Notes= suggest rather than tell the student and help him to
  get, instead of getting for him, that acquaintance with the orator
  and with the language which is the result of true study.

  =The Vocabulary= shows great care and thoroughness and meets the
  requirements of the average student.

  =The Maps= are accurate and drawn especially for this work and the
  Illustrations are happily chosen to illustrate both text and time.

LATIN LITERATURE OF THE EMPIRE

  =Selected and Edited with Revised Texts and Brief Introductions=

  By ALFRED GUDEMAN, Ph.D.
  Associate Professor of Classical Philology,
  University of Pennsylvania

  =In Two Volumes. Cloth, 12mo.  Per Volume, $1.80=

  VOL. I--PROSE. Selections from Velleius, Curtius, Seneca
  Rhetor, Justinus (Trogus Pompeius), Seneca, Petronius, including
  Cena Trimalchionis, Pliny the Elder, Quintilian, Tacitus, Pliny the
  Younger, Suetonius, Minucius Felix Octavius, Apuleius--Ammianus
  Marcellinus, and Boethius.

  VOL. II--POETRY. Pseudo Vergiliana, Aetna, Manilius,
  Calpurnius, Nemesianus, Phaedrus, Lucan, Valerius Flaccus, Seneca,
  the Octavia (anonymous), Persius, Statius, Silius Italicus, Martial,
  Juvenal, Pervigilium Veneris, Ausonius, and Claudianus.


The works of Latin Literature of the post-Augustan period have hitherto,
with a few notable exceptions, been virtually excluded from the
classical curricula of colleges and universities.

The present collection has been made primarily for the use of students
in higher classes in colleges. The selections will be found useful as
collateral reading in connection with lectures on classical literature,
and will also furnish suitable material for sight reading.

The selections themselves contain nothing that is not eminently worthy
of perusal. They are in every case sufficiently extensive to give a
continuous and coherent story, which at the same time exhibits the
author at his best. The text follows the best modern editions, the
deviations from the standard texts being briefly recorded in critical
appendices.

INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF LATIN INSCRIPTIONS

  By JAMES C. EGBERT, Jr., Ph.D.
  Adjunct Professor of Latin, Columbia University

  =Half Morocco, large 12mo, 468 pages. With numerous illustrations and
  exact reproductions of inscriptions    Price, $3 50=

This work is designed as a text-book for the use of students in
Universities and Colleges, and also to furnish an account of this branch
of archaeological study for general readers. It has been prepared in the
belief that a knowledge of epigraphy forms an essential part of the
equipment of a teacher of the classics, and that the subject itself has
become so important as to justify its introduction, in elementary form
at least, into the curriculum of undergraduate studies.

A distinctive feature of the book is the number and character of its
illustrations,--there being over seven hundred cuts and diagrams of
inscriptions, for the purpose of illustrating the text, and for practice
in reading. Of these, over one hundred are photographic reproductions,
showing the forms of the letters and the arrangement of the
inscriptions. The work is also supplied with an exhaustive bibliography
and valuable tables of abbreviations, archaisms, etc.

FIRST LATIN READINGS

An Equivalent for Caesar

  by

  ROBERT ARROWSMITH, Ph.D.

  and

  G. M. WHICHER, M.A.

  Instructor in Classics, Packer Collegiate Institute, Brooklyn, N.Y.

  =Cloth, 12mo, 344 pages. Price, $1.25=

This work has been prepared in response to a growing demand for a new
first reading book in Latin, offering more simple and interesting
material for the second-year work than is now provided by Caesar’s
Commentaries, the first connected reading pupils meet in the Latin
course.

It is the aim of the present volume to offer for the student’s first
reading in Latin, material in which the least difficult Latin comes
first; which contains the largest possible general vocabulary, instead
of a small special vocabulary; which is drawn from a wide, instead of a
narrow, range of literature; and which may be associated with other
departments of teaching with greater success and productiveness than
Caesar’s Commentaries.

The selections in First Latin Readings have, therefore, been chosen with
reference to their difficulty, their interest as literature, and, as far
as possible, their relation to Roman life and custom, and not with
reference to their exclusive use as drilling material on formal
classical construction.

Exercises in Latin prose composition, based on the text of each author
represented, have been prepared, and are included in the book.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
