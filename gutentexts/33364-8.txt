A New Subspecies of the Fruit-eating Bat,
Sturnira ludovici, from Western Mexico

BY

J. KNOX JONES, JR., AND GARY L. PHILLIPS


The fruit-eating bats of the genus _Sturnira_ are represented on the
North American mainland by two species, _S. lilium_ and _S. ludovici_.
The former, in most areas the smaller of the two, is widely distributed
in México and Central America and is common in many places. On the
other hand, _S. ludovici_, described by Anthony (1924:8) from near
Gualea, Ecuador, generally has been regarded as rare; insofar as we
can determine only 20 specimens of the species have been recorded
previously from North America (Costa Rica, Honduras, and México).

In 1961 (M. Raymond Lee) and 1962 (Percy L. Clifton), field
representatives of the Museum of Natural History collected mammals in
western México. Among the bats obtained by them were 23 specimens of
_S. ludovici_, which represent an heretofore undetected subspecies that
is named and described below.


Sturnira ludovici occidentalis, new subspecies

_Holotype._--Adult female, skin and skull, no. 92798 Museum of Natural
History, The University of Kansas, from Plumosas, 2500 feet elevation,
Sinaloa; obtained on August 31, 1962, by Percy L. Clifton (original no.
2939).

_Distribution._--Western México; known certainly from south-western
Durango south to southern Jalisco (see Fig. 1).

_Diagnosis._--Size small both externally and cranially (forearm in
adults 40.4-44.1 mm., greatest length of skull 21.7-22.9); rostrum
short and abruptly elevated; skull relatively broad; dorsal pelage drab
brownish over-all, usually lacking epaulets (pale yellowish brown when
present); ventral pelage brownish gray.

_Comparisons._--From _Sturnira ludovici ludovici_, the only other
subspecies of the species, _S. l. occidentalis_ differs in averaging
smaller in most external and cranial dimensions (in some measurements
the upper size limits of _occidentalis_ barely overlap the lower limits
in specimens of _ludovici_ examined), in having a relatively broader
skull with a shorter, more abruptly elevated rostrum, and in being
paler both dorsally and ventrally.

From _Sturnira lilium parvidens_, with which it is sympatric, _S. l.
occidentalis_ usually (but not always) differs in being brownish
(rather than yellowish to yellowish orange) dorsally and in lacking
epaulets, and differs in the following cranial features: first upper
incisors simple (rather than weakly bifid in unworn condition), larger,
and more nearly straight when viewed from the front; second upper
incisors reduced; lower incisors bilobate rather than trilobate;
lingual cusps on m1 and m2 greatly reduced; M2 usually turned inward
from M1 at distinct angle. The two species have approximately the same
external and cranial dimensions in western México.

_Measurements_ (in millimeters).--External measurements of the holotype
are as follows: total length, 58; length of hind foot, 15; length of
ear, 18; forearm (average of both), 42.5. Corresponding average and
extreme measurements of 11 adults from 4 km. N Durazno, Jalisco,
followed by those of eight adults from 17 km. SE Talpa, Jalisco, are:
61.9 (59-65), 60.9 (57-68); 14.1 (12-15), 13.0 (13); 16.1 (15-18), 16.0
(15-17); 42.2 (40.4-43.8), 42.9 (41.6-44.1); weight in grams, 16.8
(15-19, six specimens only), 19.2 (16.3-22.5).

Cranial measurements of the holotype additional to those given in Table
1 are: condyloincisive length, 19.7; breadth across upper canines, 5.5;
length of mandibular tooth-row (c-m3), 6.7.

_Remarks._--The pattern of geographic variation in size in _Sturnira
ludovici_ resembles that in many other species of tropical bats in
North America in that individuals from the northern parts of the range
are smaller than those from the south. Mexican specimens herein
assigned to _S. l. ludovici_ average somewhat smaller than specimens
from Central America and the northern part of South America (but are
within the currently understood size limits of that subspecies) and
average paler as well. Additional material is needed from central and
eastern México before the limits of distribution of the two subspecies
of _ludovici_ can be determined accurately.

All specimens examined of the new subspecies were trapped in mist nets.
The holotype was captured in a net stretched across an old road among
large fruit trees situated along a small river (a tributary of the Río
del Baluarte). Tropical deciduous vegetation grew in the narrow valley
of the river but the adjacent hills supported oak. A specimen of
_Artibeus jamaicensis jamaicensis_ was netted along with the holotype
and on the previous night, August 30, one individual each of
_Glossophaga soricina leachii_ and _Sturnira lilium parvidens_ were
taken in the same net. Baker and Greer (1962:69) also reported the two
species of _Sturnira_ as netted together 6 mi. S Pueblo Nuevo in
adjacent Durango.

Other specimens of _S. l. occidentalis_ were taken under the following
circumstances: 17 km. SE Talpa, Jalisco (night of November 3-4,
1962)--nine individuals netted over the Río Mascota in "pine-oak zone"
along with representatives of _S. l. parvidens_, _Artibeus toltecus_,
_Chiroderma salvini_, _Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis_, _Lasiurus
borealis teliotis_, and _Rhogeëssa gracilis_; 20 km. WNW Purificación,
Jalisco (night of November 20-21, 1962)--two specimens captured in a
mist net stretched beneath branches of a fig tree at the edge of the
Río Jicote in which _Glossophaga commissarisi_, _S. l. parvidens_,
_Artibeus turpis nanus_, and _Artibeus lituratus palmarum_ also were
taken; 4 km. N Durazno, Jalisco (nights of November 21-22 and 22-23,
1961)--11 specimens, of which 10 were females, netted in company with
_G. s. leachii_, _S. l. parvidens_, _A. j. jamaicensis_, _A. toltecus_,
_Centurio senex_, and _L. b. teliotis_ over a stream in a small canyon
that supported "fairly dense stands of very tall deciduous trees." Five
of the 10 females from 4 km. N Durazno were pregnant; each contained a
single embryo. Crown-rump length of the embryos averaged 26.8 (24-30)
mm. No gross reproductive activity was evident in other females of _S.
l. occidentalis_ collected.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
